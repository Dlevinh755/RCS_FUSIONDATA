I received the watch, new, with all necessary items included.  The schedule was easy to load.  However, for some strange reason, it did not play the school's fight song.  I think it had the National Anthem, instead.  I contacted the company and was given an upload to fix this.  Well, the season ended and I was able to show off my watch that cost me a hundred bucks.  Now, I can just go on the website and download the basketball schedule, right?  Except, it costs Money to do that.  And, at the time (a few years ago) I bought this, they did not have the UF basketball schedule available.  Then I learned the saddest part of all when I went to upload the following season's football schedule.  To update the schedule every year for football, it costs extra money.I was very unhappy with that fact.  It was not mentioned anywhere when I first purchased this years ago.  The battery crapped out after a year and a half and I decided it wasn't worth paying the extra money each year for a battery and for the new upload.Also, the USB adapter that connects to the watch isn't very well made.  The piece that grips it to the watch broke after the second upload.  I was able to hold it in place and successfully use it, but just thought I'd let you know to be very careful when using it.Two more things; 1.  It defaults all games to 12 O'clock and will not update when the times change throughout the year.  How lousy is that?  You pay for one upload, you get only one upload.  2.  It does give you the schedule for other SEC teams.

The Safety Cat is a self defense, personal protection tool designed mainly for women. As women we are told for safety reasons to have our keys in our hands as we go to and from our cars. Many of us even hold our keys between our fingers walking through parking lots or out doing errands so we will be able to fight off an attacker. Unfortunately, that can be cumbersome and awkward. If you're in the position of fighting off an attacker the keys may shift in your hand making it difficult for the fight to continue. The Safety Cat self defense keychain will eliminate this problem. When holding the Safety Cat, your two fingers will be placed in the eyes of the cat and the face of the cat will rest securely in the palm of your hand. The smooth, sleek design of the Safety Cat will feel very comfortable in your hand and you will be able to grasp it firmly. Remember, the Safety Cat is used for self defense purposes only, but if you're fighting for your life the unique design of the Safety Cat is made for striking at the eyes of your attacker or attacking any fleshy part of the body.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31c0pDjvZKL.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B004LUXICC.jpg

My BIG problem with these are the lenses.  They scratch easily and are a PITA to clean!!!!  They like to get this milky/foggy coating that won't come off the glasses.  Water won't work, the cloth they give you won't work, you need to get soap and water and go at them to really get the lenses clean.

The one thing I would change if I could would be the length of time that the indiglo stays lit once you press the button.  When I look at my watch in the night I can read the time in a fraction of a second, but the light stays on for a couple of seconds after the button is depressed.

AZJ4QGE380I9R,B004ET07XI,GirlScoutDad,"[6, 6]","I've had my Casio G-shock G7900MS-1B black watch with blue trim for about a week now, and I'm absolutely delighted with it.  It keeps great time, it's comfortable on my wrist, the rich blue trim against the black surfaces is appealing yet masculine, and there are so many fun features on the thing that it's more like a wrist toy than simply a wristwatch.One of the coolest and most useful features is called ""auto-electro-luminescence"" or ""Auto-E.L."" for short.  With this feature, you can set the watch so that the back-lighting lights up whenever you raise your wrist up toward your eye to check the time.  The screen stays lit up for 5 seconds.  This feature is extremely useful if, say, you've got one hand on your telephone and want to check the time of the phone call, without putting the phone down to push the little back-light ""on"" button with your other hand.  You turn the auto-EL on or off with the push of one button.  Furthermore, the auto-EL turns off automatically after six hours, to conserve battery life.  This is really useful if, say, you turn the auto-EL on at bedtime, because it will automatically turn off approximately when day breaks the next morning.  As you can see from reading my review, I'm delighted with this feature.There are lots of other cool features as well: you can set the watch to beep each hour, or not.  With the ""timer"" function, you can count off a period of time (say, 15 minutes of break time from a conference), and the watch will beep when the 15 minutes have elapsed.  You can also set the timer function to automatically repeat over and over again - say, when you want your child to begin her homework after a 10 minute break, and she begs for another 10 minutes and you give in, over and over again.The phases of the moon function is pure, meaningless folly, but fun.  Yes, I have found that it accurately displays the correct phase of the moon, but who really needs this information??? If you're in a profession that really needs this information, say -- an astronaut on a flight to the moon --- I suspect that you're going to have other, more sophisticated sources of determining the phase of the moon and it won't be left up to you and your Casio.  But, it's fun nonetheless.  And the tides?  who really cares?  What are you going to do - walk into a room and announce, ""it's 8:30 am, and by the way, it's Neap Tide in the Chesapeake Bay ...""  But again, harmless fun.The watch has an easy toggle between 12/24 hour time display, a feature I find useful as an emergency services worker.  Date and day of the week are also prominently displayed in the main display.  The face of the watch is quite legible -- I find many watch faces annoying these days because all the secondary features tend to get in the way of simply telling the time, but this Casio model avoids that annoying pitfall.The buttons are easy to use and watch appears very well-made.  And it's inexpensive enough so I don't have to fret over getting it scratched, worn, or roughed-up.  I've worn it in business settings and while exercising with equal comfort and confidence.  I'm not a computer expert, but with the help of the manual and about 30 minutes of studying it in a quiet place away from children and other distractions, I was able to master all of its many features (stopwatches, timer, alarms, auto-EL, ""world time"", etc.).I have to sit through a lot of meetings, conferences, etc., and they are somtimes overlong and boring and I have a bit of ADHD, so my Casio is a lovely little, innocuous distraction during these eternal meetings. My children think the watch is cool, too.If there is any negative at all, it is simply that the watch is rather large.  Even though it's very light-weight, you will still notice it at times on your wrist due to the size, and it will catch on things when, for example, reaching into the back of a crowded regrigerator to get something at the back.I would heartily recommend this fun, attractive, quality, multi-function watch to anyone and everyone.",5.0,"A really cool, useful, attractive, huge wristwatch.",1302825600,"04 15, 2011",Casio G-Shock Rescue Black Blue Mens Watch G7900MS-1B,94.95,Watches,"['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches']","Black resin case with a black resin / blue bracelet.

As any Timex Ironman you get the time, day of the week, day of the month, the month, a chronograph (timer), and 3 alarms. Also like any Timex Ironman it is very reliable, well working, and lightweight, which you probably already knew. But out of them all you should definitely opt for this specific model, mainly for its exclusivity among other digital watches you may say being worn during any kind of sport. It is roughly 43 mm going from left to right, which is a good size for a dress watch and quite large for a sports digital watch such as this. The orange case is also unique and a very bright, colorful, and nice touch. FYI if you are worrying about the extra size causing the watch to weigh more, don't bother, it is still practically inconceivable on your wrist as of weight.

A3JSOR11MKK20S,B0012MX23W,Chris,"[2, 2]","Well I have to admit that this is the most expensive watch that I've ever owned.  I think my highest priced one was less than a hundred bucks.  Moving up to the $650 range was a big jump for me.  The photo on this webpage doesn't do the watch justice, it's like looking at a fuzzy outline of a beautiful woman compared to seeing her in person!  This watch is simply breathtaking.I love that it has a chronograph but it's not too busy like most and you can easily see what time it is at a quick glance.  For some reason I thought this watch had a screw down crown but it doesn't.  And the bezel doesn't rotate.  The user manual said you can use it for swimming and snorkling but not scuba diving, you need 200 m water resistance for that.  It also says that you shouldn't use it in a hot tub or it can leak from the heat, interesting.  I also thought the tritium would glow a bit brighter than it does, it's rather dim but it is readable in any light if you look close.I had to bring it to the shop to get one link removed and they charged me ten bucks, probably because they saw an expensive watch and figured I could afford it, they were right!  Getting the watch serviced may be tricky depending on where you live.  Here in Colorado there is only one shop that is qualified to work on it.  You can see the shops at the traser.com website.  I really love the gun metal grey band, it's really solid and has a good feel to it.  It looks like it would be extremely scratch resistant and it you did happen to scratch it I bet it wouldn't show very much because of the textured finish which is like a very fine sand blasted finish.By the way, it's not listed on this site but the face is 40mm which is a really nice 'normal' watch size.  The face may be a little thick but I don't think its out of balance with the watch.  Overall I would highly recommend this watch, at least now that I've owned it for half a day.  Hopefully in a few weeks or months my review won't change!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Update:  I weighed my watch today and it was 112.2 grams with one link missing.  By the way, I tried to find another watch that had tritium tubes, a titanium band, and a sapphire crystal and I can't find one anywhere.  Apparently this watch has no competition if you want those three things!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Another update:  Well I wore the watch to bed last night and woke up in the middle of the night to see how bright it was and lo and behold it was really really bright!  I guess it just takes some time for your eyes to get used to the darkness and this thing really lights up!",5.0,Fantastic watch!`,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",Traser Men's Classic watch #T4006.657.35.01,648.0,Watches,"['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches']","Swiss Ronda 5040.B/quartz movement, Military watch, Classic Chrono BD, White luminous hands, White dot markers, Analog date display, White indices and luminous accents on outer concave ring, Brushed titanium silver-tone bezel is etched with a white tachymeter ruler, Brushed titanium silver-tone case, selector buttons, crown and screw-in caseback, Sapphire crystal, Scratch resistant, mb-microtec H3 illumination, 100 meters/330 feet water resistant",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41xpE7T03OL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B0012MX23W.jpg

It was a little difficult to figure out how to add or take away links for a good fit. The instructions are minimal. I was afraid of doing something wrong and breaking the plastic links.

A2VHP44PQYX1CC,B0017LLTVK,S. Busby,"[1, 1]","I like to wait awhile before I review items to see if they live up to my expectations.  I bought a pair of these pants about a year ago and they do...so much so that I bought another pair about a month ago.My work is outside and requires a lot of kneeling on concrete, asphalt, or rocky ground while repairing equipment.  These are the best pants I have ever owned in more than 25 years of this work.Some things I like about these pants:1. A year later and the original pair I bought shows hardly any wear.2. The extra wide/long belt loops don't tear off like thin ones do.3. The knee pads are removeable so I can use one pair for both pairs of pants.4. The knee pad pockets are built-in, so I don't have to mess with straps that are either so loose that they slip down or are so tight thay they chafe the back of my knee and/or cut off the circulation to my leg.5. Each knee pad pocket has a pocket inside on the bottom so the knee pad will not fall out.6. I can put items in the utility pockets and wear the pockets outside my seatbelt when I'm driving so I can easily reach in to get something.7. The fabric is strong and durable (see #1), yet they are breathable enough to not get overheated in hot summer weather.8. There are more than enough pockets for everything I usually carry.Some things I don't like about these pants:A year later and I still really can't think of anything.  Yes, they are a bit pricey, but they are worth every penny.  They last long enough to more than make up for the extra expense.  I will be getting more in the future so I can throw away my ""swiss cheese"" pants.I have had many people see these pants and ask me where I got them.  I tell them to go to Amazon.com and search for Blaklader (which I have to spell for them).  OK, maybe an easier name would be nice!8/24/13One minor negative and one suggestion for improvement.  The kneepads location is a little low for me, so I have to hike up my pants before I kneel down or else my knees will hit the ground above the pads.  The suggestion is that they make these with shin pads as well!  Ouch!The first pair of pants I bought a few years ago finally developed a hole in one knee and the zipper pull broke off.

I live in Chicago and our winters can get wet. Driving the kids in the morning was simple. I didn't have to tie anything and didn't need hands to get them off.

It is the same chain shown with the Charles-Hubert Paris Mechanical Pocket Watch, and silver in color.The watch itself is beautiful and has some serious weight to it.  It arrived in a black cardboard box within a box, so the packaging has a nice presentation if you are buying this as a gift. The watch was in a black cloth cinched bag inside the inner box. It also comes with rudimentary instructions and a lens cleaning cloth.  The watch itself displays upright very nicely on a desk with its swiveling leg stand.One reviewer said one of the ""pins"" on the leg stand came out of their watch.  I examined mine and the ""pins"" actually appear to be tiny phillips head screws.  I can't imagine how they would work themselves out of the watch except through frequent manipulation of the stand or a poor borehole for the screw.  The screws on mine appear to be very secure.The second hand on my watch was at the 30 second mark when it arrived and as soon as I began winding the watch, it began moving.  There is no way to stop the second hand with the stem once it gets moving if you want to set the time precisely to UTC.  So before you begin winding it, if you want to match it to UTC, don't starting winding it until the UTC seconds count is where your second hand is.The front glass cover is large enough to see the entire face of the clock.  The only reason you would ever need to open it to read the time is if you put a photo in the cover.  The glass cover does screw off for ease of placing a photo in it, and the bezel is studded so you can grip it easily enough to unscrew it.The back of the watch presents a very sensual, buttery look with the brass casing and inner works visible through the rear glass.  All of the crystals are glass on this piece, not plastic.Make sure you read the instructions before winding the watch or fiddling with the stem to open and close the cover.  It takes all of one minute to fully understand the instructions, but they are important to read and understand.This watch is definitely worth the price.

The back snap pocket is perfect for frequently used items such as a phone.I'm thoroughly impressed by the water resistance of the outside; a heavy downpour caught me and the outside of my bag was drenched, but its contents was dry.  Finally, I'm surprised by how much I like the magnetic closure.  I worried it wouldn't be strong enough to keep the flap closed, but if the flap catches, the magnet draws it closed again.There's only one downside: The strap, while it doesn't loosen, rubs on my neck.

Ive used it daily since then, with almost no issues.  Coming from a trifold, it did take a bit of getting used to, but the 6 slots were more than enough to hold my cards and license.  The leather felt exactly like the leather in my E36 M3, and smelled like one too.  The only complaint I have is that when you put any more than $300 in 20's in the wallet, it starts to not close all the way.  This wallet was very durable, even going through the washer a few times, as well as falling in the pool/ or getting thrown in the ocean, and even after all those, no discoloration, or fade to the wallet, and the emblem never chipped or lost any of the blue/white pattern.I highly recommend this wallet to anyone who likes BMW",5.0,Fantastic Wallet,1358726400,"01 21, 2013",Genuine BMW Men's Small Leather Wallet,34.0,Men Clothing,"['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Accessories', 'Wallets, Card Cases & Money Organizers', 'Wallets']","Black leather billfold center divider and four credit card slots. 3.07""h x 4.1""w.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-QVVUwyUL._SX300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B006JVOYF6.jpg

Even my mom, who doesn't like large watches, thought this was nifty.And it is a relatively large watch.  The center section is over an inch wide, while the rest of the band is probably about half an inch (my best guesstimates).  For all that, though, it's not masculine.

It's a little beat up now (I wasn't joking about knocking it around), but I received many compliments when I first bought it.  I don't much use the center section but it's pretty easy to read.My only complaint is that when one side of the face came loose from its &#34;leather&#34; moorings, it was really difficult to not only get back in but to also keep it back in.  It's probably something you can have a jeweler or a watch-person or a really handy individual do for you, but, for me, it kept happening at really awkward times.  Eventually my really handy uncle fixed the situation and I haven't had trouble with it since.  Perhaps the thing to do is have it checked out immediately and avoid the problem?

Here are some of the problems I've had with it.1.) Connecting to your cell phone can take a really long time. It usually takes me three tries to get it to connect, it always starts working on the 3rd attempt. I wonder why.2.) The glass is very easily scratched! You definitely need a screen protector. I have two giant gouges and the funny thing is, I have no idea how or why. They just appeared. I'm sure I did something, but I don't remember it going through any trauma.3.) The charger isn't super great. The magnet that keeps it together is pretty week and you can't plug it into a wall to charge. You can only plug it in to a computer via USB to charge. It would be much more convenient if I could plug it in.4.) There aren't many good options for covers and cases. Maybe I'm just picky, I just wish there was a bigger variety. Most of them are stickers. If there were more snap on/snap offs to match different outfits and I'd be much happier.Overall, it's a good product.

This intelligent Storm Alarm--one of several intelligent features designed to keep you safe and secure--is activated by a rapid drop in air pressure over a three-hour period. Once the Core senses the change, the Storm Alarm sounds and flashes, letting you know that something unpleasant is fast approaching.

Accurate to within 30,000 feet, the altimeter is an extremely valuable tool for mountaineering, backcountry skiing, and wilderness travel.

Additional features include several traditional watch functions, including dual times, a date display, and an alarm; predicted times for sunrise and sunset to help you maximize your daylight hours; an automatic Alti/Baro mode that senses movement or lack thereof and switches between the altimeter and barometer accordingly; a depth meter that provides accurate water depth readings to 30 feet; and the ability to function in English, German, French, and Spanish.

Using an old wetsuit and some sharp scissors, he made the first pair of eyewear retainers. The ingenious device was based on the design of a Chinese finger trap, and quickly became a hit with local ski patrolers. Demand picked up quickly for the patrolman's invention, which was initially nameless. Back in the seventies, the Jackson Hole ski patrol used the nickname ""croakies"" when they couldn't think of a word (think ""thing- amajig""), but it finally stuck on the world'd first neoprene eyewear retainer.Croakies headquarters are still in Jackson Hole, with production in Bozeman, Montana. The inspiration remains the same -- to create eyewear retainers and accessories that provide comfort, style, durability, and functionality to active people of all ages. Croakies products are sold by retailers throughout the United States and in over 30 countries around the world.

ADLN2ZHL23BA2,B00BKEQBI0,Customer1701,"[0, 0]","This was purchased as a tech toy. Smart watches are still in their infancy. Even so, this unit is well thought out, and even for its simple design, it does a fairly good job.The watch comes with a set of 'faces' (digital, not physical) which are different watch faces to tell time. You can download more via the companion application you have to install on your smart phone. Yes, you have to pair it with a phone to use it. The companion application offloads things like information retrieval (weather, GPS, etc) from the watch, reducing the electronic complexity in the watch itself.There are other applications you can download into the watch beyond the basic watch faces. There are 8 storage spaces in the watch to run them. Some may come in 2 parts, and this take two spaces. So it is no memory behemoth. You are not going to upload your MP3 collection into it. It doesn't even have speakers to play them anyway. Also of note: the watch does not run two programs at once. You run the one you want, switch to another and the first is shutdown.It does have a 'buzzer' motor built in. It can be used to tick off the hour, or used as an alarm. Very quiet and effective, unless you suffer from some nerve damage that leaves your arm numb to sensations like that.One application I use beyond the information tools, is a sleep monitor. It samples the watch's built in accelerometer while it is running, to get an idea if you are sound asleep, lightly asleep, or seemingly wake (tossing and turning). The companion app can then give you a chart in the morning of how you did. It also has a smart alarm function that will wake you up, theoretically at the best point within a wake up time range you set. This isn't a serious health application. But it is a good toy that gives you insight into you sleep patterns.Battery life is fair. It certainly beats a typical phone's battery. I charge my PEBBLE every four or five days, when it is down around 30 or 40 %.Construction is solid. You are NOT ever going to open this thing up to change the batter or explore. People who have done that end up with a badly 'damaged' watch that requires nasty glue jobs to get it back into workable shape. So, in essence this is a throw away toy. If it dies, you are not going to get it repaired (when outside of its warranty). But at its price, compared to other smart watches, it hurts a bit less to let it go.If the price is too steep to you, then yes, it is too steep. This is not a watch you will keep for years and years. There are far better watches you can buy, to tell time with. This is an early stage smart watch in a world where people think they must trade their cellular phone out for a new one every 2 years or so. It would be so nice if they made a smart watch with an expected 10 year life cycle, with replaceable parts. This isn't that.The requirement to tie it to your iOS or Android smart phone, reduces its value a bit. But then, if it could gather information all on its own, it would cost a heck of a lot more. So it is a good entry point to explore the ideas of what a smarter watch can be.",4.0,So far so good.,1397952000,"04 20, 2014",Pebble Smartwatch for iPhone and Android (Black),149.0,Watches,"['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Smart Watches & Accessories', 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Jewelry: International Shipping Available', 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches', 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches']",,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41t32YBS8nL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B00BKEQBI0.jpg

Using an old wetsuit and some sharp scissors, he made the first pair of eyewear retainers. The ingenious device was based on the design of a Chinese finger trap, and quickly became a hit with local ski patrolers. Demand picked up quickly for the patrolman's invention, which was initially nameless. Back in the seventies, the Jackson Hole ski patrol used the nickname ""croakies"" when they couldn't think of a word (think ""thing- amajig""), but it finally stuck on the world'd first neoprene eyewear retainer.Croakies headquarters are still in Jackson Hole, with production in Bozeman, Montana. The inspiration remains the same -- to create eyewear retainers and accessories that provide comfort, style, durability, and functionality to active people of all ages. Croakies products are sold by retailers throughout the United States and in over 30 countries around the world.

The Safety Cat is a self defense, personal protection tool designed mainly for women. As women we are told for safety reasons to have our keys in our hands as we go to and from our cars. Many of us even hold our keys between our fingers walking through parking lots or out doing errands so we will be able to fight off an attacker. Unfortunately, that can be cumbersome and awkward. If you're in the position of fighting off an attacker the keys may shift in your hand making it difficult for the fight to continue. The Safety Cat self defense keychain will eliminate this problem. When holding the Safety Cat, your two fingers will be placed in the eyes of the cat and the face of the cat will rest securely in the palm of your hand. The smooth, sleek design of the Safety Cat will feel very comfortable in your hand and you will be able to grasp it firmly. Remember, the Safety Cat is used for self defense purposes only, but if you're fighting for your life the unique design of the Safety Cat is made for striking at the eyes of your attacker or attacking any fleshy part of the body.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31c0pDjvZKL.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B004LUXICC.jpg

The AmberWatch was designed to complement safety plans made with parents and to aid in an immediate escape. It is a 115-decibel alarm built into a watch that, when activated, can be heard from 100 yards away. An unmistakable distress signal, it draws attention to dangerous situations and helps children respond strongly when they feel threatened. It can also come into use when a child is lost in a store, park or crowd, when they&#x92;re threatened by an animal, if they&#x92;re hurt, or if they get lost while participating in activities such as camping, skiing or hiking. The watch has a bulky modern style and super-bright LED lights that can be seen night or day. Digital functions include time, date, alarm, stopwatch, day of the week, low battery and backlight. The alarm is activated by pushing both of the red buttons on either side of the face and deactivated using the same 2 buttons in a coded sequence you set yourself. A special break-away back-up system automatically activates the alarm if the watch is forcibly removed. Amber Watch donates $1 to the AmberWatch Foundation for every watch sold. Water resistant.

One thing is the light button.

There is no instruction book that comes with the product, just a bunch of stupid pictures that aren't very helpful. I understand you can google it and find some other instructions, but for $60 Nike really should be giving you instructions on how to use it.2. There are only two buttons. Of the 17 or so runs the website says I've done, at least 5 are completely empty because I couldn't get the screen to go to running mode and it ended up just ending the ""run."" Can they not put a start and stop button on the thing? Would that be so hard?3. And those 5 empty runs? Yeah, once they're uploading to the website, you can't delete them. Which means all my averages are off, and they are pulling down all the statistics that I actually wanted to look at, hence why I started using the band in the first place.4. Even after calibrating three runs, when I can get the thing to work it is normally short by at least a quarter mile. And, it uploads the uncalibrated runs again to use in the statistics, so my mileage looks a lot shorter than it really is.5. It can't handle sprints or really any change to your stride since it's all based on how many steps you take.Honestly, this thing does not work at all for me. It has taken the fun out of my runs. Maybe other people have had more success with it, but it's worthless to me. I aim to run about 10-15 miles per week and am probably around a 12 minute mile pace and I was using it with a pouch on my laces, not a Nike shoe.

Anyway, they do what they are intended to do.  And, apparently, with some people, they make a marked difference in your appearance.  For example, upon seeing me wearing them for the first time, one friend exclaimed, &#34;I didn't know that you wore contacts!&#34;  When I asked why she said such a thing, she told me that this was the first time she'd seen me in glasses, so I must have been wearing contacts all the other times.  Truth is, over the past 4 years, she has never seen me without glasses.  Admittedly, they were gold tone wire frames.  So, they were about as unobtrusive as glasses can be.  Still, these made such a dramatic difference that she seemed to forget that I'd ever worn glasses at all.

Using an old wetsuit and some sharp scissors, he made the first pair of eyewear retainers. The ingenious device was based on the design of a Chinese finger trap, and quickly became a hit with local ski patrolers. Demand picked up quickly for the patrolman's invention, which was initially nameless. Back in the seventies, the Jackson Hole ski patrol used the nickname ""croakies"" when they couldn't think of a word (think ""thing- amajig""), but it finally stuck on the world'd first neoprene eyewear retainer.Croakies headquarters are still in Jackson Hole, with production in Bozeman, Montana. The inspiration remains the same -- to create eyewear retainers and accessories that provide comfort, style, durability, and functionality to active people of all ages. Croakies products are sold by retailers throughout the United States and in over 30 countries around the world.

My parakeet is also inlove with it as a head-scratching post. I bought it to replace a similar watch given to me by my husband when we were expecting our son 9.5 years ago. (The ingiglo feature finally gave out.) The alarm features on the first watch were the best and I wanted that again! I could take a nap anywhere I needed to -- Contrary to some reviews, the alarm is more than enough to wake me up. Later on, it was just plain handy to have a timer, alarm, etc. right on my wrist wherever I went without the bulk of the big watches I'd seen before. Now, my 9.5-year-old son wants a watch with an alarm/timer so that he can remember to come home on time, so I'm getting him this because it's not as bulky, once again, as the men's watches.My only complaint is that it only has 3 alarms (my previous one had five), but that's just an inconvenience, not really a problem.

A27T14S5ILTXYJ,B0083XFFLU,Maps,"[1, 2]","*** Update 5/2/13*** It is a pleasure to report that it has been almost 4.5 years and this product is still working flawlessly. I used it on a 5.5 mile run and it is as good as the day I got it. See comments to this review -- others have made good tips that I agree with. The bottom line -- if you are still using it after this amount of time, you are either ready for an upgrade or at least won't mind having to buy another unit!Original Review:I'd hoped that getting this new running gadget would encourage me to exercise more often. So far so good. I asked for this for Christmas and, well, it has accomplished it's primary function for me... I've been running almost every day since I got it. I was turned off by the gigantic size of some HRMs, and did not need something to keep track of splits as I run on my treadmill at home and the gym.As a heart rate monitor, the functionality is pleasantly simple. It tracks your heart rate for the whole workout. You hit the big button to start, and it goes to work tracking the length of time, the average heartbeat, and the peak. While you are running, it displays your current heartbeat. That's it -- but sometimes it's better to keep it simple.I should point out that, as a watch, the watch piece tells the time and date only. If you want/need splits and a stopwatch, you should look elsewhere.Here's some other thoughts: I was worried that the strap would break but realized after a couple workouts that I was probably wearing it a little too tight. Since adjusting, it is much more comfortable, has not fallen off, and, as a guy, you *almost* forget that you have it on. My wife cracked up when I took my shirt off after a recent workout. She said that, from the back, it looked like I was wearing a bra (or Manzierre, or Bro, if you prefer).I had no original intention of wearing it while NOT working out, but I've found it addictive, and have enjoyed observing how drinking a cup of coffee while sitting at my desk does raise my heart rate about 10-15 beats per minute on average. Also, as I've started to get in a little better shape over the last 3 weeks, I see that I have to run either farther or faster to get my heart rate up to certain thresholds. And, now my heart rate does not go up as high from merely climing the stairs at home. I believe that these insights, among others, are very encouraging for someone who is just getting back in shape. The encouragement aspect combined with the simplicity makes this a great starter heart rate monitor for anyone considering.",5.0,Timex,1377820800,"08 30, 2013",Timex Men's T49896 Expedition Rugged Shock Digital Chrono Alarm Timer All Black Resin Strap Watch,34.22,Watches,"['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches']","The Timex Men's T498969J Expedition Full Size Chrono Alarm Timer Watch is a great example of a cool, casual timepiece packed with style.

Im really only giving the watch 4 stars due its limit of only 8 watch faces or apps that can be installed at one time. This limit is arbitrary considering how small the file size of the watch faces are compared to some of the larger apps.My only other gripe is that Amazon sent me what is clearly a refurbished watch masquerading as new. The one I got has glue oozing from the side and what are clearly dents in the plastic from an apparent screw driver being jammed into the plastic housing to replace the screen. But Amazons return/exchange policy is easy and convenient so I'm not to worried for now.This watch is definitely a go!",4.0,Great Watch!,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",Pebble Smartwatch for iPhone and Android (Black),149.0,Watches,"['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Smart Watches & Accessories', 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Jewelry: International Shipping Available', 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches', 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches']",,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41t32YBS8nL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B00BKEQBI0.jpg

AQ8ZHOOXFNF8S,B004C2C0AK,Donald Brande Jr,"[1, 1]",I waited almost one year to write this review since I feel it is necessary to really get to know a product before I give an opinion. Out of the box this watch was just OK. Yes it is plastic and to me that is not a problem but it has a black rubber wrist strap and that was the first thing I replaced. I recommend the Luminox Evo velcro strap as it fits perfect on this watch and is way more comfortable for everyday wear. I found the rubber strap to be hot and sweaty especially when I was out on the boat in the sun.For daily wear you will almost forget you are wearing it because it is so light. At least if you follow my advice and loose the rubber strap. The illuminated dial and hands are great for night time viewing. The watch also keeps excellent time. In almost one year it has failed to loose one minute! I can not say the same thing for my 3K cost Tag Heuer. The only issue I ever had with it was that I dropped it from the kitchen counter on the hardwood floor and the second hand jumped one second requiring the watch to be taken apart and the hand reset. I also have to say the crystal has held up very well to daily use. I have one very small scratch near the outside of the crystal that you have to look very hard to see.I would not hesitate to recommend this watch to anyone looking for a durable accurate inexpensive timepiece.,4.0,Been a good watch for the money,1394841600,"03 15, 2014",Luminox Colormark Chronograph Watch,365.15,Watches,"['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches']","The Luminox Colormark chronograph was designed for functionality, durability, and ease of reading.

A1IR4C71ZD5C7Y,B00BKEQBI0,Jason Patrick Quattrone,"[0, 1]","I've owned a Pebble since x-mas, and I really love it; however, I love it for the wrong reasons. This device is simply fun to own. At most I enjoy changing and creating watch faces for it. In fact, that's really the only thing I use it for. Imagine owning a device that you can change the look of at will. If you get bored of a watch face, you download or create a new one.Now, on to the actual functionality and usability of the Pebble. As of now, there's simply not enough usage for the Pebble. It doesn't allow much of any useful interaction between it and the smartphone outside using it to control song play on your smartphone. For example, you can receive text notifications, but you can't reply to them. It doesn't even have built-in generic responses such as, &#34;okay,&#34; &#34;see you later,&#34; etc. There are also a number of apps for weather and battery notifications, but many of the watch faces include that information. Again, the watch faces are really the highlight of this device. Recently they've been releasing games for the Pebble. I don't understand why, as it's awkward to play a game on your wrist, and the not to mention that the button are a bit flimsy and cheap feeling. I can see them popping off from repeatedly being pressed. It's also a bit buggy. There are times when for any reason at all you won't get notifications, weather updates, etc. and a bluetooth resync is in order.So why did I give this device 4 stars you ask? Because the cool watch faces make it worth buying. As stated above, many watch faces include information such as weather and battery status. The Pebble store has hundreds and possibly thousands of faces to choose from. Love Star Wars? There are tons of Star Wars watch faces. Love the look of a Rolex watch? There's a Rolex watch face in the store. You can even make your own watch faces if you can't find one of interest. The best part is that you don't have to be a programmer. There's a website called http://www.watchface-generator.de/ that allows you to create your own faces and upload them to your Pebble. I only pair the two to transfer watch faces, and I do find it useful to have on when I'm teaching in class and can't get to my phone.As a consumer, you have to decide what your looking for in a smart watch. If you want something that acts like a true smart device, then get the Samsung Gear, or whatever Apple releases for IOS.

A3C4F6EIBG4UA9,B001BR3364,92FSTech,"[0, 1]","I was very pleased with the results I got from this chronograph. I took it out into the woods and set it up. It was a moderately sunny day, and there were tree limbs overhead, but using the provided sunshades it gave me consistent results for loads out of my Marlin 1894 in .357 Magnum from about 15 feet away. They were also pretty much in-line with what my reloading manual said they should be, so I am pretty confident in the accuracy of the readings as well.I then switched to the same loads out of my 2-inch snubby revolver, and got errors from the first two shots...not too surprising to me considering the muzzle blast out of the snubby is pretty ridiculous. I backed up a few feet and it began registering the shots successfully. Then I let one of my rounds stray a bit to the left and hit one of the rods for the sunshade support. The sunshade went flying, but was unbroken. The rod was bent into a ""u"", but I straightened it out in my vise when I got home, and it's (almost) as good as new. I know there have been some complaints on here about the flimsiness of the sunshade, but you will be happy for that if you hit it...it keeps stuff from getting broken.Overall, I'm very pleased with this product. I did a significant amount of research before purchasing, because I'd read a lot of frustrated comments regarding chronographs in general. I didn't want to go cheap and get junk, but I didn't want to spend a bunch of money for something that didn't work any better than the cheaper option, either. I was very pleased with the results that I got from the chrony, especially considering that is is pretty much the cheapest option out there.

All earlier models I had, the bands broke in about 2 years, and it was cheaper to buy a new watch than replace the band.  The resin band on this one is very flexible and has a long life expectancy in my opinion.

A2YDMJ0TUEBOZL,B005OS7O8E,CFIIPLT,"[2, 4]","As a previous owner of at least 3 Casio G Shock watches, this one is my favorite. There are numerous reviews on the amazing features of the G shock watches,so I will not be commenting on any technical specifications-you can read about those details on Casio's website.Now on to my review...first, the size of the watch itself is large but not huge. I don't have a large wrist and this watch fits very nicely on my wrist. When I compare it to my Casio PAG-240 watch, I would say that it actually wears a little better than the latter watch. The case itself is 51mm. The weight of the watch is surprisingly light, after a few minutes on your wrist you may forget it's there.The color of the watch is one of my favorite designs. The band is a resin, matte, white finish. I was a little skeptical of the color at first...because of color fading, discoloration and how a white watch would look on a man. I can tell you that after wearing the watch for 2 weeks, I love how the watch looks! Trust me when I say people will notice your watch! The combination of the white case and band contrasting with the dark face really pops on your wrist.People will be looking at your watch before they make eye contact with you. White Casio G Shock watches are hard to find in stores where I live. You will be the proud owner of a watch that looks very unique and expensive.The face of the watch is my next favorite feature. The actual color is more gun metal than black imho. The dials on the face display different items. The alarm,hourly signal,snooze and auto light is on one dial. The other 2 dials display stop watch seconds and speed information. This is a way to input a known distance and then in conjunction with the stopwatch use the display to calculate speed!The digital-analog box displays the time in either 12/24hour formats. The other box displays the day of the week and seconds. My least favorite feature is with Casio's choice of color for the displayed numerals-they are a very faint, light silver color. In bright daylight, of low light situations you will have a very difficult time seeing the display. I work in an office environment everyday,so the fact that the display is very hard to read doesn't apply for most of my daily use. I can read either the analog or digital display quickly. The hour and minute hands are nice and large-so you can tell the time quickly during the day.At night or in low light conditions you will need to use the led light. The led light is bright and although it does not actually illuminate the hands or the display boxes,it does a sufficient job of creating ample light in which to read the hour/minute hands. You will not be able to read the digital parts but the rest of the watch is illuminated enough to see the hour markers. On a side note,the hour markers are glow in the dark reflective so that helps.The watch case itself has a nice look and feel to it. It appears rugged in design and has several screws in place to help hold it together. The watch of course is waterproof,anti-magnetic and shockproof. Again, if not familiar with the G Shock family you can read all about the design/features on Casio's website. Casio has been making G Shock watches for over 25 years and they keep improving their product each time.In conclusion, I own 3 G Shock watches now, and have never had a minutes worth of trouble out of any of them. They are built to last, and they do. The combination of the white matte band and gun-metal face add a very attractive time piece to your wrist. The only negative would be the previously mentioned faint color digital display. I would not let that discourage you from purchasing this watch. The  watch has been worn under long sleeve shirts, winter jackets and has been in my wrist for 2 weeks and it appears to remain in perfect condition, the band and case has remained in its pristine white color.Lastly, the only thing that would make this an absolutely perfect watch would be the inclusion of a solar battery.I would highly recommend this watch from Amazon and Casio...in fact the longer you wait the more it costs. The watch is in high demand,limited quantities(even on Amazon) and rises in price daily. I paid $98 for mine 2 weeks ago.This watch will not only help you tell the time, it will help those around you tell time because they will be STARING at it!",5.0,Casio G Shock GA 100B-7 White,1357948800,"01 12, 2013",G-Shock Limited Edition X-Large Classic Series Watch,103.0,Watches,"['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches']","The popular X-Large Classic Series Watch from G-Shock is tough, durable and stylish.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-es%2BRDWSL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B005OS7O8E.jpg

What I like most about it is that it keeps logs of the past 60 stopwatch times you have posted, which makes it easy to keep track of your run times. It's also the perfect size. Many men's watches are really big and I prefer to have something lightweight and unobtrusive when I am going out on runs.The stopwatch also has a distinctive beeping noise for starting and stopping so you can tell if you have accidentlally started or stopped the stopwatch when you didnt mean to. I have not tried the pacer function, but I wouldn't expect it to work too well since it calculates distance based on your average stride length and counts on you running at the same pace the entire time.I was a little worried about the start/stop/reset buttons being hard to press based on other reviews, but I do not have any trouble with this on my watch. The buttons are easy to press for the stopwatch functions.

Using an old wetsuit and some sharp scissors, he made the first pair of eyewear retainers. The ingenious device was based on the design of a Chinese finger trap, and quickly became a hit with local ski patrolers. Demand picked up quickly for the patrolman's invention, which was initially nameless. Back in the seventies, the Jackson Hole ski patrol used the nickname ""croakies"" when they couldn't think of a word (think ""thing- amajig""), but it finally stuck on the world'd first neoprene eyewear retainer.Croakies headquarters are still in Jackson Hole, with production in Bozeman, Montana. The inspiration remains the same -- to create eyewear retainers and accessories that provide comfort, style, durability, and functionality to active people of all ages. Croakies products are sold by retailers throughout the United States and in over 30 countries around the world.

Since then I've never been a fan of expensive sun glasses.The only reason I rated this product a 4 and not a 5 is because they are certainly not on par with Oakley's, Costa's, or RayBan's; and I wouldn't want anyone to think you get anywhere near that kind of quality for $20. That's like expecting Cadillac quality when purchasing a Kia. They both do the same exact task, get you to point A to point B effectively, one simply does it with a lot more quality, comfort, and style than the other. But if someone dings the car door at the grocery store of my $15k Kia, it hurts a lot less than my $60k Cadillac.That said, they do a great job of blocking glare, are comfortable enough to wear all day, and look good. Which, in my mind at least, is everything a good pair of cheap sunglasses should do. If I drop them or scratch them, I won't lose 10 minutes off the duration of my life being p.o.'ed at myself.Even while kayaking Tampa Bay under the bright Florida sun my eye's were relaxed in these, which says a lot because my light blue eye's have always been particularly sensitive to sun light.

When doing high-energy aerobic activities, particularly outdoors, too much sweat can be your worst enemy, and Helly Hansen base layers are engineered using the company's unique Lifa Stay Dry Technology, one of the first moisture-wicking fabrics ever created, back in the 1970s. When exposed to moisture, Lifa fibers immediately move it away from your skin, speeding evaporation or moving it on to the next layer. Lifa is also 40% lighter and 60% warmer than polyester. HH Dry material, part of this line, forms the base of Helly Hansen's 3-Layer System, creating a dry layer next to the skin to keep you comfortable during highly aerobic activities in a wide range of conditions.WarrantyFor more than 130 years, athletes and explorers have trusted their lives to Helly Hansen clothing.

Helly Hansen footwear is covered up to one year against defects in materials and workmanship. This policy does not cover normal wear and tear on the product.About Helly HansenOne of the most well known outdoor gear makers around, Helly Hansen was first established in 1877 when Norwegian captain Helly Juell and his wife Maren Margarethe started making oilskin jackets, trousers, sou'westers, and tarpaulins, made from coarse linen soaked in linseed oil. Their products' unusual durability and weather protection quickly caught on. The company won a diploma for excellence at the 1878 Paris Expo, and began exporting its products.Over the course of the 20th century, Helly Hansen led the way in innovating outdoor apparel technologies:1949: Helox, a thin sheet of translucent PVC plastic sewn into waterproof coats, took over for oil-based outerwear and became the industry standard.1961: Fiberpile, the original fleece, was first introduced. This new insulation layer was warm, lightweight, and -- most unusually for the time -- quick-drying.1970s: Lifa fiber was developed to keep the skin dry and warm by wicking moisture away from the body. This unique base layer is still used in the company's product line to this day.1980: Helly Tech hydrophilic, microporous materials were introduced, bringing waterproof breathability to the outdoor garment market.Today, Helly Hansen gear is used by elite competitive sailors, skiers, and outdoor adventurers, as well as those who simply appreciate being protected from the elements when weather's at its worst.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/319vPilyyXL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B001N2MLQA.jpg

Do not misunderstand, the watch is EXTREMELY reliant on your smart phone, but who doesn't have a smart phone?  it has a very noticeable vibration mechanism for incoming calls, emails, texts, etc. and a recent update has made those notifications more customizable.

I don't carry my cell phone around my house any longer because the range essentially reaches my entire house if my phone is in my kitchen (I have a 3000 sq foot, 2 story home for reference).It doesn't have a camera, it's not a color display, it's not really a device on it's own like the Samsung watch, that's a very different animal, so don't expect that.

A31PDR78F1MNDI,B0036C4GN6,"Smaug ""Jeremy""","[8, 9]","I'm a  Casio watch fan. My mom is in her early 60s, and she likes small round analog watches, with full arabic numerals. But the problem with those is battery life. They last one year, max. Then, they charge her $7 each time to change them.Finally, I told her to stop that, let me change them. (watch batteries are three bucks for ten through amazon...)There is always the option of solar watches, which theoretically never need a battery, but they are still expensive for a decent one.Meanwhile, I bought her this watch. Casio digital watches have no moving parts, and the batteries tend to last FOREVER. This one, I'm sure will go at LEAST 3 years before needing a battery.Now, even for a person who generally prefers analog watches, one has to admit that the features on this are wonderful:- Easy-to-use countdown timer. They're all presets, so no having to set them! Also, they can be activated from the home screen. Very easy to use, even for those of us who are not technically minded.- There is of course a stopwatch and alarm too. If you care to learn how to use them, they can be well worth the time.The watch is also light, accurate, and has just a bit of flash. Gold watches aren't popular now, especially not digital ones. But silver doesn't match with everything, right?  It matches a gold wedding band splendidly.The bracelet is gold plated on the outside only. The inside and sides are brushed stainless steel. I wish they had plated the sides, but it is a thin bracelet, so not noticeable, once on the wrist. The bracelet is folded steel links, which can occasionally pull an arm hair, if you have many on your wrist. In this case, I can recommend a nice brown leather strap; they are ALWAYS more comfortable than a bracelet, because they breathe.In the end, I think my mom will stick with her quartz analog watches most of the time, and my hope is that she will wear this one around the house, and maybe use the timer to help her remember things, like steeping tea, cooking a dish, changing laundry, etc.Or maybe she will wear it for a nice change of pace sometimes?

AE3LTF12I774P,B00BKEQBI0,Maxwell Thomas,"[2, 2]","I have had a black Pebble for a week.  Overall, I really like it, and it does everything advertised on the Pebble site, but I am a person who needs the basic, limited functions the Pebble offers.  It easily paired with my Galaxy S3 phone, using bluetooth 4.0.Connectivity: I can connect with my phone anywhere in my 1 story 1300 sq ft house, but once I walk out the front door, the signal drops. In the last 7 days, it has been super reliable and never dropped the phone's signal except when out of range.There are only 30-40 apps so far, and they are limited because the Pebble is controlled by only 4 buttons and does not have a touch sensitive screen and does not run Android independently.  I can't browse the web, but It does everything I need it to do: displays incoming emails, texts, caller id, and other phone alerts.  Like others, I love being able to SILENCE my phone, leave it in my pack, and not have to worry about missing anything.  It is far more conducive to sharing time with friends than pulling out a phone that beeps every time I get an email- which I feel compelled to check even though it's mostly useless ads.  Any smartwatch will do that, though: the Pebble just fills the bill at the lowest price point.  I am hard on watches and did not want a big investment while I tried out the smartwatch concept- I paid $150 at Best Buy last week, the standard price.  I don't know why sellers are charging so much more on Amazon.Comparing other smartwatches: If you like your watch to stand out, don't get the Pebble.  It is the Anti-Rolex.  It is simple, clean, and a bit elegant while a tad chunky.  It is all plastic and does not look as expensive or draw as much attention as a metal watch or watch with a bright color display.  Not to rip it, but if other people never saw the incoming texts or other trick functions, they might think you paid $30 for it at Ross Dress for Less Outlet.  The watch face is NOT mineral glass, and scratches somewhat easily, so get a screen protector.  The simple black and white display is much easier to see in sunlight than my Galaxy S3, though.  If you want more smart phone functions the Geak Watch (yes, Geak), which runs full Android 4.X, speaker + mike and has wi-fi built in.  Or the durable/multipurpose waterproof microphone/speaker Kreyos watch (this would have been my pick if it were available today).  Or the Omate TrueSmart, which is a veritable smartphone on the wrist. Most smartwatches are still on the ugly side, but the wild, curvy bracelet style Emopulse has the most hypertech bling by far. It is truly amazing and you should check it out. These watches will make the Pebble look very limited in comparison and the Pebble team will have to have a Pebble TWO to compete or go under soon.  So if you can wait, you will certainly benefit. The Sony SW2, which will be released in early October 2013, is a very worthy competitor that will be lighter and slimmer than the Pebble.  It would make a better dress watch, has a few more apps, more flexibility due to the touch screen, and Sony quality control. I like it a lot and I was going to buy it, but found out that it is not as waterproof as the Pebble and has much worse battery life.  The Galaxy Gear is definitely far more advanced than the Pebble and the Sony, but is compatible with very few phones, too heavy, expensive, and has horrible battery life.Many of these ""about to be released"" watches may also suffer initial quality control problems, further delaying purchase.  While the Pebble is not issue-free, and least the issues are pretty much known as people have using them a few months now and are very vocal on the forums.The Pebble site lists the battery life is about 7 days with average use.  I have not had to charge it yet and I read about 20 emails, 5 texts, three reminders, and screen about 10 calls per day. So it seems very efficient because of its EInk display and more efficient bluetooth 4.0. One gripe, though, it that it does not store any old messages, texts, etc.  It seems to purge everything right after I read it.I measured the main unit at about 1.2 cm thick, 5.1 cm tall, and 3.4 cm wide.  Despite its size, it is light and fairly comfortable. I thought the brightly colored Pebbles (like the red one), made the screen look smaller and accentuated the plastic appearance.  The black case blends in with the display and gives the illusion of a larger display.Beware of screen problems, though: when I am out on a hot day, I get a dark, blotchy-cloudy pattern under the surface of the display (in areas that should be bright white). It does not prevent viewing, but looks bad.  It went away after the watch sat overnight.  This problem is common- see the Pebble forums. Ordering direct from Pebble, they do NOT consider this a defect/reason for refund.  So I highly recommend buying  from a store like Best Buy so you can get your money back, no questions asked.  Personally I decided the cloudiness was not a deal breaker- but if you are a fashionista or particular about the clean look of your electronics it will probably bother you.A Pebble app released in May, ""Pebble Dialer"" allows you to accept/reject incoming calls from the watch, but I have not tried it.  With a bluetooth headset, or just ear buds, this is a killer feature for taking calls while driving.  Coincidentally, if you go to Google Play and search for Pebble Dialer, you will see pretty accurate pictures of the blotchy display problem.Some apps you might think would be included, well, aren't.  There is no indicator, alarm, or anything to tell you that you have lost bluetooth contact with your smartphone (in that case, the Pebble is just a watch... if you have silenced your phone, you would be unaware that you are missing messages).  Very poor planning on Pebble's part.  There is no countdown timer for those cookies you are baking, nor a stopwatch function.  Perhaps the MOST useful would be a function to use the Pebble to locate a lost phone: a button sequence to press that would make your phone sound a loud ring or alarm noise when you lose it (mine is so slim, it slips between couch cushions very easily)!But the biggest benefit of the Pebble (or ANY smartwatch that is NOT an independent mobile phone) is not so obvious and almost never discussed: minimizing radiation damage. Now I can carry my phone farther away from my body, inside my backpack or briefcase, vastly reducing exposure via the inverse squared law.  While the jury is still out about radiation exposure, cancer, and other hazards from cell phones, the Pebble seems to be very wise insurance. Carrying any cell phone on my body more than an hour per day seems like a very bad gamble. Combine that with being able to silence my phone while spending time with friends, and still not miss any messages (the social grace factor) was easily worth $150.  Without the blotchy display, I would have given it 5 stars.",3.0,Best smartwatch on a budget but BEWARE of display issues,1380240000,"09 27, 2013",Pebble Smartwatch for iPhone and Android (Black),149.0,Watches,"['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Smart Watches & Accessories', 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Jewelry: International Shipping Available', 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches', 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches']",,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41t32YBS8nL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B00BKEQBI0.jpg

This intelligent Storm Alarm--one of several intelligent features designed to keep you safe and secure--is activated by a rapid drop in air pressure over a three-hour period. Once the Core senses the change, the Storm Alarm sounds and flashes, letting you know that something unpleasant is fast approaching. The built-in altimeter, meanwhile, displays your current elevation, shows how much you've climbed or descended, and records your entire session for later analysis. Accurate to within 30,000 feet, the altimeter is an extremely valuable tool for mountaineering, backcountry skiing, and wilderness travel. Add in such features as a barometer, a digital thermometer, a weather trend indicator, and a digital compass and you have a terrific wrist-top computer for almost all your outdoor needs. Additional features include several traditional watch functions, including dual times, a date display, and an alarm; predicted times for sunrise and sunset to help you maximize your daylight hours; an automatic Alti/Baro mode that senses movement or lack thereof and switches between the altimeter and barometer accordingly; a depth meter that provides accurate water depth readings to 30 feet; and the ability to function in English, German, French, and Spanish.

A3GTCIBA6KGCG0,B003XF8RWC,momof3cincy,"[0, 0]","My daughter has been telling me for quite awhile that I need a Kangaroo Keeper. I am very anal with organization inmy purses, and I HATE the ones that don't have pockets inside for cell phone, etc. Well, after getting a purse that had pockets, yet too shallow to keep anything in, I decided to buy one. I found mine at CVS, in the black, and I LOVE it! Fits perfectly inside, and allows me to stay organized with all of the pockets, and the larger one allows room for my bigger wallet, lotion, etc. Mine didn't have a foul smell, but it did have a rubbery smell, kind of like a rubber raincoat. I have a very sensitive sense of smell, and my husband doesn't even notice the odor, so most might not either. But the smell hasn't seemed to fade, it's been about a week, and my wallet and such have a slight rubbery smell when I pull them out, but it's not offensive. So they must have corrected the original problem. But the rubbery smell is the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5. I love it though. And I'm very excited that I can finally carry a purse I love with ZERO pockets inside, cause the Kangaroo Keeper does a great job. Haven't used the smaller one yet, but seems nice for those tinier purses. I may even try to find a tan one someday, but I'm loving the black. If you like to be organized, I definitely recommend it.

A1YLX4A4XBJ3WJ,B00BKEQBI0,Michael Bednarsky,"[2, 2]","This is a very handy and convenient sidekick to my phone.  I use it with an iPhone and I love that I can see my notifications as they arrive without having to take my phone out of my pocket.  I get a lot of email so this allows me to decide which notifications need immediate action and which I can ignore for now.  The watch vibrates when you get notifications and phone calls.  I used to miss a lot of phone calls because I could not feel my phone vibrate in my pocket; now, I do not miss any calls!  It is very easy to feel the watch vibrate on your wrist.The watch is water resistant and should be resistant up to a very deep depth (a friend had calculated it for me, and I don't remember exactly what the depth is, but it was so deep that you do not even have to worry about ever reaching that depth)!  I have used it in a pool and water park, and the watch was unaffected.  Of course, I did not have my phone near me while I was swimming, so I did not receive notifications during this time.  But at least I could still use it as a basic watch while I was swimming.The bluetooth range is about 30 feet, so you don't always have to have your phone in your pocket for the connection to remain.  It will work a few rooms away.  Unfortunately, if the watch disconnects for whatever reason, there is no built-in warning.  However, there are some watch faces that you can download from the Pebble Store on your phone that will vibrate your watch when the bluetooth disconnects.  In order for that to work, however, that watch face must be running at the time that the bluetooth disconnects in order to be notified that it has disconnected...the watch does not &#34;multitask&#34;.  In short, do not rely on receiving a notification from the watch telling you that it has lost the bluetooth connection.  You shouldn't have to worry about connection, however.  Once you get the initial connection when you power on the watch, you will not have a problem maintaining the connection unless you break the 30 ft. bluetooth range.The battery life is fantastic.  The watch lasts me about 5-7 days of all-day use, powered off only at night.  Furthermore, it charges extremely fast; it usually takes about an hour to completely charge from about 10-20% to 100%.  This is probably because the watch does not use a lot of power so it has a very small battery that discharges slowly and charges quickly.The display is black and white.  It has a decent refresh rate, so games from the Pebble Store will run decently considering that it is running on a low-powered watch.  The display is always on, which is a great feature!  Other smart watches have color, LCD displays that use more battery power so therefore the display cannot stay on all of the time.  The Pebble utilizes a low-powered display that may not look as pretty but it is able to stay on all of the time which I think is much more convenient.  The display has a backlight, and there are a few options you can set with the backlight: you can set it to always turn on when you get a notification or push a button, to only turn on when you get a notification or push a button in a low-light setting (recognized via the watch's ambient light sensor), or to never turn on.  You can also set the watch to turn on the backlight when you flick your wrist (so that you can quickly check the time).  I have mine set to only turn on the backlight in low-light settings...this way I save some battery since I am keeping the backlight from turning on when I don't need it to.  I turned off the wrist flick setting since I found that the backlight would turn on when I am going up stairs, moving my arms intensely, etc.The rubber band is comfortable and widely adjustable to many sizes.  You can upgrade to a steel band if you buy the Pebble Steel instead, which is about $100 more than this product.  In my opinion, the rubber is just fine and it does not look tacky or cheap.If you own an iPhone, you may know that the iPhone is much more restrictive with what applications are allowed to do as compared to Android.  Therefore, there is a little bit of extra effort to keep the Pebble working on iPhone.  Almost every time that I power on my Pebble for the day and connect it to my phone, I receive a notification on my phone asking to allow Pebble to communicate with my phone.  Notifications to your Pebble will not work until you accept this message on your phone.  It is a minuscule thing to do once a day, but it is crucial for receiving notifications on your watch, so don't forget to do it!  Sometimes the message will not appear and notifications work just fine.  Other times, the message will not appear and notifications do not work!  To fix this, simply open the Pebble app.  After opening the app, everything should start working as long as you have a bluetooth connection.  To be safe, every day when I connect my Pebble, I open the Pebble app on my phone and then close it.  That should take care of everything.  Just be careful not to completely close the app from the background (on iPhone, double tapping the home button and closing it through the multitasking tray).  If you do this, notifications will not work.  The Pebble app must be open in the background for notifications to be sent to your watch.I have also discovered that there is a preferred order of powering on your devices.  Sometimes I could not get my Pebble to establish a bluetooth connection with my phone.  I found that if you first turn on bluetooth on your phone and then turn on the Pebble, it will connect with no problem.  Sometimes turning on the Pebble prior to turning on bluetooth on my phone caused the devices not to connect.The selection of apps for the Pebble is not extensive, however at the same time I cannot really imagine what else you can do with a watch!  There are a few apps I do use regularly, including Runtastic (which displays the duration, distance, and pace of my workouts on my watch screen), the music app (pre-installed, allows me to skip songs, play/pause, and adjust the phone's volume), a metronome (as a musician, it keeps a pulse on my wrist...it will vibrate to the tempo), alarm (vibrates when time is up), and Tiny Bird (the Pebble equivalent of the Flappy Bird game).There is a very extensive selection of watch faces (the main screens that tell you the time and some other info).  My favorite is Fair Weather, which displays the time, date, the watch's battery life, a graphic icon of the current weather conditions, sunrise and sunset times, moon phase, barometric pressure, humidity, cloud cover, wind direction/speed, and temperature....all on one screen!  This information is updated over the internet through the Pebble app on your phone.  As long as everything is connected, the information will update automatically every hour and will even automatically adjust your location based on your GPS location (if you allow the Pebble app to use GPS on your phone).IN SHORT...this is an excellent companion for my phone and provides many great features and a stylish new look.

A14MMP5DUIGOJP,B000H6APZM,R. Mansfield,"[0, 0]","This is a good, disposable watch that I expect to last about two years. On the plus side: the watch is smaller and lighter than my previous watch (a G-shock); the display is easy to read, and the buttons seem to work easier. On the minus side: the strap feels a bit brittle compared to straps on previous Timex sports watches, and the loop through which it must be pushed is very thin. The strap loop was a weak point on a previous Timex watch. When it broke, the replacement cost would have been $11 or so -- too high in relation to the cost of replacing the entire watch. In my experience with these watches the strap, strap loop, or battery fail in 18 months to 2 years. But the price of the watch is low enough that I am happy to replace the watch regularly. Because of my experiences with straps and strap loops failing, I plan to wear the watch most of the time (even when showering, so that I am not stressing the strap or strap loop.One final note: the buttons are a darkish blue that makes this watch look more sporty than if the buttons were black.

Using an old wetsuit and some sharp scissors, he made the first pair of eyewear retainers. The ingenious device was based on the design of a Chinese finger trap, and quickly became a hit with local ski patrolers. Demand picked up quickly for the patrolman's invention, which was initially nameless. Back in the seventies, the Jackson Hole ski patrol used the nickname ""croakies"" when they couldn't think of a word (think ""thing- amajig""), but it finally stuck on the world'd first neoprene eyewear retainer.Croakies headquarters are still in Jackson Hole, with production in Bozeman, Montana. The inspiration remains the same -- to create eyewear retainers and accessories that provide comfort, style, durability, and functionality to active people of all ages. Croakies products are sold by retailers throughout the United States and in over 30 countries around the world.

Therefore I wanted to find a pair of overboots that I could use to put a pair of more supportive shoes inside them.  These work beautifully.  I just bought the pair of men's boots that was comparable to my size in women's shoes. (Just do a search for a comparison chart of men and women's shoes sizes if you're not sure what to get.)  The top of the boots is just about mid-calf for me.At first I thought I was never going to get my shoes pushed inside them, but they did indeed finally slip in.  I would hate to have to pull the boots on and off shoes all the time though.  I just put an old pair of shoes inside the boots and leave them there.Pros:* Thicker than most overshoes, like the kind usually just pulled over dress shoes.* Good traction.Cons:* Hard to pull over shoes if you are going to do it on a regular basis, though other people might have more strength than I do and not find it so difficult.* The fasteners are elastic loops that fit over &#34;buttons&#34; on the shoes... the first time I pulled on one to fasten it, the loop went flying off and under an entertainment center!  Just be careful when fastening the boots so you don't lose the loops!  For myself, I'll confess I don't bother fastening the boots.  They work just fine without doing so.Overall, I would recommend these boots, especially for someone who would like more support than most boots have.  Just find an old pair of shoes... the soles were coming off the walking shoes I put in mine, but it doesn't matter since the boots are waterproof and hold them in place.

Composed of 100 percent New Zealand merino wool, the Icebreaker Bodyfit260 line takes high-tech, high-performance sport clothing back to nature with its natural fiber construction. A base layer in cold conditions, and a standalone during high aerobic activities and in warmer temperatures, the Bodyfit 260 Mid-weight Tech Top is highly breathable, will not hold odors, and offers maximum warmth with great temperature regulation for high-performance comfort.Icebreaker uses the best superfine merino in the world, from the mountains of New Zealand. In contrast to synthetics, the Icebreaker merino fabric is finer, softer, more insulating, and more breathable than alternative fabric types. The lightweight, odor-resistant, and soft-against-the-skin fabric breathes better than other garments because each individual merino fiber breathes as well as the fabric, allowing your body to release moisture vapor so that you never feel clammy.The Bodyfit260 Mid-weight Tech Top has a three-way collar that will zip up to a high neck, zip down for cooling, or roll over. A slim fit offers a form-flattering look and flat seams provide zero-abrasion comfort. The all-natural merino fabric features a circular knit that offers a natural stretch that will maintain its shape over years of use. With a dropped tail and thumb loops the shirt will stay in place even through the most rigorous activities. Easy to care for, the Mid-weight Tech Top is machine washable and fast drying. Additionally, the Bodyfit260 fabric will not absorb odors as synthetic fabrics do.Specifications:Base layer100 percent New Zealand merino wool260g/m2 ColdCircular knit with natural stretchRaglan long sleevesHigh neckThree-way collar (zip up, down, or up and rolled)Thumb loopsDropped tailFlat seamsBreathableOdor freeSize Specifications:X-Small: Bust 33 inches; height 62.5 inchesSmall: Bust 35 inches; height 64 inchesMedium: Bust 37 inches; height 66 inchesLarge: Bust 39 inches; height 67.5 inchesX-Large: Bust 40.5 inches; height 69 inchesCare Specifications:Icebreaker garments almost look after themselves because they don't hold moisture or odor. In fact, the known record for wearing an Icebreaker non-stop is 196 days in extreme conditions. Here are a few tips to get the best out of your Icebreaker.Use warm or cool machine-wash on normal cycleWash separately first (after 2 to 3 days use) to remove any loose fibersWash with like colorsWash on a normal cycle with other hard fabrics to remove fluffingNever use a fabric softenerDo not use detergents with bleachDo not tumble dry--dry flat in the shade or on the clotheslineAbout Icebreaker Merino WoolIcebreaker uses the best superfine merino in the world, from the mountains of New Zealand in all of its garments. Icebreaker's merino fiber was created by nature to protect animals in the harsh environment of New Zealand's Southern Alps. If the fiber didn't work, the animals wouldn't survive. Recognizing that it couldn't design a better fiber, Icebreaker turned nature's merino wool into a clothing system for humans. In contrast to synthetics, Icebreaker merino is 100 percent natural. The fabric created is finer, softer, more insulating, and more breathable than alternative fabric types.Icebreaker merino forms a buffer zone around your body, keeping you at an ideal temperature in all climates and conditions. It's also lightweight, odor-resistant and soft against the skin--all qualities that will help you to perform at your peak. Because Icebreaker merino fibers are so fine, they are naturally more breathable, so you stay cool in the hottest conditions. It feels very different than synthetics, where breathability is limited.Icebreaker garments breath better than other garments because each individual merino fiber breathes as well as the fabric allowing your body to release moisture vapor so that you never feel clammy. In a warm, high aerobic environment, sweat is pulled from the body into the fabric, and dispersed and metabolized as moisture vapor through the outside of the garment, cooling the body through evaporation. In cold temperatures, when moisture is absorbed from the cold air, Icebreaker merino fibers liberate heat through a molecular process call ""heat of sorption"" to keep you warm.Manufacturer Warranty1-year warranty",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GxXM9LRFL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B001F50H48.jpg

What can the Suunto Core do for you? For starters, it can sense an approaching squall even when the sky looks clear. This intelligent Storm Alarm--one of several intelligent features designed to keep you safe and secure--is activated by a rapid drop in air pressure over a three-hour period. Once the Core senses the change, the Storm Alarm sounds and flashes, letting you know that something unpleasant is fast approaching. The built-in altimeter, meanwhile, displays your current elevation, shows how much you've climbed or descended, and records your entire session for later analysis. Accurate to within 30,000 feet, the altimeter is an extremely valuable tool for mountaineering, backcountry skiing, and wilderness travel. Add in such features as a barometer, a digital thermometer, a weather trend indicator, and a digital compass and you have a terrific wrist-top computer for almost all your outdoor needs. Additional features include several traditional watch functions, including dual times, a date display, and an alarm; predicted times for sunrise and sunset to help you maximize your daylight hours; an automatic Alti/Baro mode that senses movement or lack thereof and switches between the altimeter and barometer accordingly; a depth meter that provides accurate water depth readings to 30 feet; and the ability to function in English, German, French, and Spanish.

One interesting thing though...I wore the tan hat for a couple of days, and it fit incredibly well (my head is a little large, with a high crown) When I returned it and got the black one, it is made differently.  While still fitting, it seems to be slightly smaller in circumference above the adjustable band in the back.I still love it, and will wear it often, but I wonder about the difference in the hat.  Perhaps a different person sewed the black one?Also, the shipping was incredible.

The Safety Cat is a self defense, personal protection tool designed mainly for women. As women we are told for safety reasons to have our keys in our hands as we go to and from our cars. Many of us even hold our keys between our fingers walking through parking lots or out doing errands so we will be able to fight off an attacker. Unfortunately, that can be cumbersome and awkward. If you're in the position of fighting off an attacker the keys may shift in your hand making it difficult for the fight to continue. The Safety Cat self defense keychain will eliminate this problem. When holding the Safety Cat, your two fingers will be placed in the eyes of the cat and the face of the cat will rest securely in the palm of your hand. The smooth, sleek design of the Safety Cat will feel very comfortable in your hand and you will be able to grasp it firmly.

AG6JJG6UOKBX,B0067WLT6Y,Dr. Rob,"[3, 5]","I buy everything I review. To receive FIVE stars, a product must meet &#62;90% of the manufacturer's claims. I don&#8217;t subtract because I don&#8217; t like the color or appearance (too subjective and personal). I review form, function, ease of use, and construction quality. Please forgive typos: I&#8217;m an evidence-based scientist, NOT a typist. If you find my review helpful, please click &#34;YES&#34;. This helps me improve future evaluations (which I do for free to help people make more informed decisions).Their Claim:  Bottom timer with watch functions and depth gaugeMy Verdict (details below):  True but with some major flawsIt's a watch, stopwatch, thermometer, countdown timer, and has dual time zones. All #'s are large enough to find and works very well. It's even stylish to wear as an everyday watch. I like the looks and these features work exactly as designed.Next, the dive component. When you go into water, it automatically changes to DIVE mode (which you can also go to by pushing the MODE button, generally to review your dives). When underwater, them mode button won't switch to any other function. It has a water sensor, and when submerged, the watch believes you are diving, and locks it into that mode. Come out of the water, and you can toggle between modes again. That is a bit troublesome as you can't tell what time it is underwater, or view the stopwatch (so, if you want to spend six minutes at a ship wreck then do something else, or you know you have to be back at the boat in 30 minutes or they're leaving without you, you can't time yourself that way; plus, you can't toggle to the time of day under water). That shouldn't be the case. But it's not a deal breaker, more of an annoyance.When you are in the water and go to about three feet, the BOTTOM TIMER (BT) starts up. That's pretty great at this price point. It works exactly as it should. But here's the problem. If you're diving, then come up to snorkel on the surface to a different dive spot 100 yards down the coast, or come up for ANY reason, the BT stops. When you go back down, it starts again from 0:00. So, on one 2 hour dive at 30-feet, during which I came up a few times to speak to my dive buddy, each time we went back down this unit THINKS it's a new dive. By the end of the two hours single session dive, it had seven recorded dives. They're numbered and easy to scroll through.The problem is that to use a dive table to calculate RNT, you need to know how LONG you've been underwater (total) and the maximum depth you achieved. To figure out your BT with this unit, I had to add up each BT from all seven dives it thought I took. Again, not a big deal, but it SHOULD have an ON/OFF button for the diving function, and simply record one dive as, get this, ONE DIVE. That is, if you come up after 7:35 to get something from the boat, when you go back down, it should start at 7:36, not 0:00. It would be SO simple to do that. In fact, when in DIVE MODE, none of the buttons do anything. So, why not assign this function to one? I guess they don't want you pushing buttons underwater as that can compromise water tightness, but it should be doable. That's my major issue. One dive is one dive; not seven or seventeen.The depth is a bit off. In a 17 foot pool, when placed on the bottom, it recorded 13.4 feet each time I brought it down (very consistent, not very accurate). That's not quite accurate enough for diving IMO.The temperature gauge seems pretty close, but I didn't know the exact temp of the lake or pool, so I can't speak to it's veracity.For the price point, this is an AMAZING deal. I'm only going on dives when on vacation, so it suits me perfectly. But if I were a regular diver, this would not suit me at all due to the BT issue, and the depth gauge being inaccurate.In reality, when I go on Caribbean dives, I usually submerge and ascend just once, so the BT issue won't be arise. Even if I made multiple ascents, I can add the dive times together at my leisure later when I get home. But if I need to know under WATER how long I've been there, which is important when you're approaching decompression time limits, this simply doesn't cut it.For the casual diver like me, this works. For a regular diver, you're going to have to spend $200+ for a real dive watch.One other thing. Having a rotating bezel on a digital watch (bezels are designed for analog watches only) is like having a tampon dispenser in a men's locker room: I mean, what's that all about?

This little aluminum, resin, and mineral glass case packs a mind-boggling array of tech tools, from an altimeter to a barometer to a compass to a thermometer, all run by a solar-powered battery that'll last for up to seven months on a single charge. The altimeter, which measures in precise one-meter increments, has automatic and manual logging functions and can hold up to 30 records of high/low altitudes, cumulative ascent and descent, with a range from -2,300 to over 32,000 feet. That's just the beginning. The PRW 3000 has a barometer as well, which has an automatic pressure-change indicator to alert you to sudden swings, along with a pressure tendency graph and pressure differential graphic to give you a longer-term idea of what the weather's doing. To keep you on course, the compass has a graphic 16-point display for one-glance orientation, a bearing memory to keep you on route, and declination adjustment so your bearing is accurate no matter where in the world you are. We haven't even mentioned the one thing the PRW 3000's designed to do first and foremost--tell the time. It receives six atomic signals a day to ensure you're always on time, has 12- and 24-hour displays and five alarms so you never miss a mealtime, and sunset/sunrise, time zone, and calendar data.

A2IBQH7SSXBIVI,B003G4FEPI,"Larry Davis ""The Sign Specialists""","[3, 3]","BON usually makes a great product.  These spiked shoes, leave much to be desired.I am a general contractor, and recently bought two sets of these for a nasty floor we were stripping of black tar mastic.  These spiked shoes arrived, and we realized they take about 20 minutes to assemble.  The spikes on the shoes are bolts that come in a baggy.After we fumbled around with the tiny parts for what seemed like forever, we strapped them on.  That is when we discovered two more fatal flaws with this inferior product.  The straps are very poorly designed and are a cheap, elastic (much like what you would have on a pair of underwear, believe it or not!) and don't tighten on your boot enough to feel secure slopping over wet tar.  The next problem is the size.  Come on, these are designed for contractors, not little boys!  They are TINY!  I wear a size 12 (the recommend using a steal toe boot, which I do anyways - Red Wing Pecos) and about 25% of my foot was hanging over the toe of these shoes.If those things were not bad enough, here comes the most annoying part... Remember the bolts I mentioned earlier?  Yeah, the 'spikes'.  Well, no matter how tight you make them the nuts work there way off, then you lose your nuts in your mastic or resin.  No fun digging them out, and even less fun fumbling with the tiny nuts when they are covered in construction grime.  One of my employees was over the boots in about 5 minutes, I fumbled and tripped on them for a few hours before I finally tossed them in the dumpster with a cuss.

Regardless of your excursion--whether it's climbing mountains, riding a muddy bike track, or skiing off piste--you need accurate, real-time information about your surroundings to pull off a successful trip. The X-Lander contributes by not only providing important data, but also keeping track of your activities so you can make rational decisions at key moments. In addition, the watch is user-friendly and solidly built, with a non-allergenic aluminum casing, a carbon-fiber back, a durable mineral crystal glass, and a water-resistant fabric strap.The built-in altimeter, which boasts a range of up to 29,500 feet, puts all 14 of the world's 8,000-plus-meter summits within the avid climber's range. Among the altimeter's functions are an altitude measurement function that lets you follow the vertical progress between stages, an automatic 24-hour memory that stores the altitude and ascent/decent rate for every hour, and an adjustable altitude alarm. Climbers will also dig the logbook function, which lets you record total and cumulative vertical ascents and descents as well as the number of runs skied.The X-Lander also displays the current barometric pressure and temperature--a must for activities in which weather plays a factor. The device automatically records barometric data for the previous four days, with the first six hours manifested in one-hour intervals and the rest in six-hour intervals. When the reference altitude is set correctly, the instrument also displays the present sea level pressure, which makes it easier to read and understand the barometric pressure at high altitudes.And few things are more important when exploring unfamiliar territory than a compass. The X-Lander's electronic compass contributes by guiding you with cardinal or half- cardinal points and a North-South arrow. The compass can also be set to track a certain bearing, which helps you follow a chosen direction. Meanwhile, the unit's declination adjustment function allows you to correct the difference between true North and magnetic North.In addition to the variety of outdoor functions, the X-Lander also displays normal time, with such add-ons as three daily alarms, a calendar programmed to the year 2089, a stopwatch with split-time measurement, and a countdown timer. Other features include a durable negative LCD display, a user-replaceable battery, and water-resistance to 100 feet.

A1AACD5F5CBSHN,B000051SEP,Ed,"[5, 5]","I bought this watch thinking that I would have an accurate and trustable device.  I don't use it as my day by day watch, and have not use it more than 10 times.  It has never been hit, I haven't dive with it (anything more than jumping on a swimming pool where I can stand up).After this, I climb a volcano in Guatemala (the country were I live), the volcano is no more than 3,500 meters and it gave me an altitude reading of 25,960 meters, definetely there was something wrong.I tried to calibrate the meter following the instructions on the manual, but it didn't work.  After that I wrote an e-mail directly to SUUNTO and never got an answer.  Finally, I decided to call the support number that is showed on their webpage and the answer that I get is that I should contact Amazon because the device was broken (without running one single test on it).I spent $ 349 on a SUUNTO device because of the brand and its reputation, but now that I used it and it is broke (according to their techincal support, which didn't run any test on it) after no more than a few uses and with no reasson to be broke.  Even if I hit it, you expect a very sturdy device when you see it and read the description.  I'm stuck with a very expensive device that can't do anything more than give you the time.They have very nice devices, but the service and support is completely unexistent.  Think twice before buying one fo this devices, I think the reputation is not really deserved.I hope Amazon could help me to solve something with this guys.",1.0,Unexistent support - the product was damaged after less than 10 uses,1358380800,"01 17, 2013","Suunto X-Lander Wrist-Top Computer Watch with Altimeter, Barometer, Compass, and Chronograph",329.0,Watches,"['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches']","The ultimate option for the outdoor enthusiast, the silver Suunto X-Lander wrist-top computer offers an accurate altimeter, a complete barometer, a precise electronic compass, and a multifunction sports watch in a single elegant package. Regardless of your excursion--whether it's climbing mountains, riding a muddy bike track, or skiing off piste--you need accurate, real-time information about your surroundings to pull off a successful trip. The X-Lander contributes by not only providing important data, but also keeping track of your activities so you can make rational decisions at key moments. In addition, the watch is user-friendly and solidly built, with a non-allergenic aluminum casing, a carbon-fiber back, a durable mineral crystal glass, and a water-resistant fabric strap.The built-in altimeter, which boasts a range of up to 29,500 feet, puts all 14 of the world's 8,000-plus-meter summits within the avid climber's range. Among the altimeter's functions are an altitude measurement function that lets you follow the vertical progress between stages, an automatic 24-hour memory that stores the altitude and ascent/decent rate for every hour, and an adjustable altitude alarm. Climbers will also dig the logbook function, which lets you record total and cumulative vertical ascents and descents as well as the number of runs skied.The X-Lander also displays the current barometric pressure and temperature--a must for activities in which weather plays a factor. The device automatically records barometric data for the previous four days, with the first six hours manifested in one-hour intervals and the rest in six-hour intervals. When the reference altitude is set correctly, the instrument also displays the present sea level pressure, which makes it easier to read and understand the barometric pressure at high altitudes.And few things are more important when exploring unfamiliar territory than a compass. The X-Lander's electronic compass contributes by guiding you with cardinal or half- cardinal points and a North-South arrow. The compass can also be set to track a certain bearing, which helps you follow a chosen direction. Meanwhile, the unit's declination adjustment function allows you to correct the difference between true North and magnetic North.In addition to the variety of outdoor functions, the X-Lander also displays normal time, with such add-ons as three daily alarms, a calendar programmed to the year 2089, a stopwatch with split-time measurement, and a countdown timer. Other features include a durable negative LCD display, a user-replaceable battery, and water-resistance to 100 feet. The X-Lander is backed by a two-year warranty on parts and labor.What's in the Box?X-Lander wrist-top computer, battery, user's manual.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RpfJIscTL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B000051SEP.jpg

The Safety Cat is a self defense, personal protection tool designed mainly for women. As women we are told for safety reasons to have our keys in our hands as we go to and from our cars. Many of us even hold our keys between our fingers walking through parking lots or out doing errands so we will be able to fight off an attacker. Unfortunately, that can be cumbersome and awkward. If you're in the position of fighting off an attacker the keys may shift in your hand making it difficult for the fight to continue. The Safety Cat self defense keychain will eliminate this problem. When holding the Safety Cat, your two fingers will be placed in the eyes of the cat and the face of the cat will rest securely in the palm of your hand. The smooth, sleek design of the Safety Cat will feel very comfortable in your hand and you will be able to grasp it firmly. Remember, the Safety Cat is used for self defense purposes only, but if you're fighting for your life the unique design of the Safety Cat is made for striking at the eyes of your attacker or attacking any fleshy part of the body.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31c0pDjvZKL.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B004LUXICC.jpg

It is the easiest to use and useful for so many things.  Under the Casio name are small numbers 1,3,5,10,15,20,30.  To set it you push the top right button once for each (i.e. once for 1 minute, twice for 3 minutes, etc.,,and to cancel it just push once more when it is set on 30).  I use it to challenge my kids (and myself) to stay on a task, and also to remind me to check up on them.  Great for Attention deficit problems.  The hourly chime and alarm and stopwatch features are also great.  Hourly to remind to check in with God or whatever.  Alarm to remember afternoon medication.  Stopwatch to know how long you've been on a task or exercising, etc.  The kids often ask me to set my countdown timer for them.  I don't even have to look at it to set it.  I just remember the #'s and think 1,3,5,10,15,20,30 as I hear the beeps when I push the button.  The watch is small and comfortable and I wear it everywhere.  Nice that it is water resistant too, no worries doing dishes or washing the car, but I wouldn't recommend swimming with it on.  One caution is when you get the battery replaced (and that won't be often because it lasts a long time), make sure the tech knows the AM/PM of the alarm might reverse, and don't leave until you're sure it's right (Set it for a couple minutes past your current time and see if it goes off, if not it is reversed).  Maybe the battery has to be put in and taken out and put in again to set it right. I don't know but twice I had that problem when I had a new battery put in.  I love this watch though.

Using an old wetsuit and some sharp scissors, he made the first pair of eyewear retainers. The ingenious device was based on the design of a Chinese finger trap, and quickly became a hit with local ski patrolers. Demand picked up quickly for the patrolman's invention, which was initially nameless. Back in the seventies, the Jackson Hole ski patrol used the nickname ""croakies"" when they couldn't think of a word (think ""thing- amajig""), but it finally stuck on the world'd first neoprene eyewear retainer.Croakies headquarters are still in Jackson Hole, with production in Bozeman, Montana. The inspiration remains the same -- to create eyewear retainers and accessories that provide comfort, style, durability, and functionality to active people of all ages. Croakies products are sold by retailers throughout the United States and in over 30 countries around the world.

Make sure you shoot straight down the middle is the lesson here.If you should use it indoors, such as for airguns, use incandescent lights, otherwise the Chrony will not see the shot (this is mentioned in the instruction manual).I think I will want to upgrade my F-1 by getting the Chrony Ballistic Printer, which will crunch numbers for me too.Word of caution, do not shoot too close to the Chrony, especially with the larger calibers (&#62;=7.62mm/.300&#34;) or magnums, the muzzle blast will scar the face of the Chrony and provide you with a cool &#34;ping&#34; sound.

I have worn several styles of MBTs and these remain my favorite in fit and appearance! I wish MBT would manufacture this style again....  I love the black & grey with the hot pink accents! Fun and pretty. I would love to purchase another pair in the right size (I wore mine to death!!)...A word of caution: MBTs are fabulous for walking. They are incredibly comfortable, make your walking movement/strides actually smoother & effortless, realign your skeletal system, and relieve foot/joint pain and discomfort; HOWEVER, the same cannot be said when standing or taking limited strides for extended period of time. I frequently lead week-long work groups and stand/walk within a confined space for hours at a time. My feet where hurting so much in my beloved MBTs that I went sock-footed and then started bringing a second non-MBT pair of shoes to change into 1/2 way through the day. So remember - These shoes were made for walkin' (not standing around!!)In my experience the most frustrating thing with MBT is that no two styles fit the same. Since there are no MBT retailers near me, I have ended up with a few pair that I might not have purchased...  or might have needed to adjust by a 1/2 size. I also tried ordering some through a non-Amazon site (at great prices)...  but one pair looked really cheap and were much too small, the other (Lami) were the same size as my original, but much too loose. Both of these 'bargain' pair appeared to be seconds and actually arrived from China - though the websites looked legit. So just a word of caution....  buy these through Amazon or a reputable, well-known site. If you find prices elsewhere that look too good to be true.....  they probably are!!

AC74ZHCKBTZJQ,B00BKEQBI0,"C. McMillan ""CMcMillan""","[8, 9]","I didn't know what to expect with this watch.  I found it when I was looking at Runkeeper, an app for tracking workouts on my phone.  I really wanted to monitor my heart rate during a workout, which is why I bought this 'watch'.  So far that's about the only thing I haven't been able to see on my wrist that I'd want.  I installed 'Glance' which is awesome, turns your watch into a quick summary of time, weather, unchecked email, txt messages, and vm's... very neatly and clearly.. oh, and it tells me the percent of battery on my phone.I received it and had it working within a few minutes.  I'm reasonably technical but I'm new to the Android world.  I'm connected with my Samsung S4.  It all works just fine.  I lost connection once but I think it was because I changed a lot of settings in the Glance app and it needed to reconnect to apply them... I don't know.Using it with Runkeeper is an analysts dream.  GPS tracks your route, you have goals, charts, graphs, real-time performance, feedback, etc.  And, on my phone I can see my heart rate.. I haven't figured out how to get a warning when I get to (or exceed) my target heart rate though.  I'm sure there's a setting, I just haven't found it.  (I'm using a Polar bluetooth HRM that sends my HR via Bluetooth to the phone, in the Runkeeper app.)I use this in my office where I am in sessions with people and it's nice to just get a quick buzz that someone has texted me... and I can ignore all but emergencies.  It vibrates like the phone when someone is calling, so it's not super quiet if it's buzzing on a desk.. but pretty quiet/discreet on your wrist.  I also see emails and can read them.With Glance there are some pre-programmed text messages you can send people... ""on my way, OK, sounds good... etc."" and you can add your own... Like, ""I'm leaving the office, hope to be home for dinner soon.""Without Glance, this is really a 1-way extension of what's on your phone with a few watch faces.  There are a good number of applications that make this watch useful to a wide variety of needs.  So far it has exceeded mine other than the heart rate thing.It's good for someone who doesn't want to keep looking at their phone or stay tethered to it.  If nothing else, I get piece of mind knowing I'll get a quick buzz on my wrist if something comes up while I've put my phone down for an extended amount of time.  Which for me is often.. Definitely worth $150 for me... it's already helped me a lot... and I've only had it 2 days.Quality-wise it's 'ok'.  It's a normal-looking watch but it is plastic.  It looks like it'll be outdated in a year.  I have a feeling it'll get a little more refined as the company gets more profit.  I look forward to it.  I'll wear this one till it wears out.  Oh, and it has a 1-yr warranty which is pretty awesome for this kind of thing.------ Update: About 5 days after getting the watch... I looked everywhere for a battery meter, there isn't one - until it starts to go down, and it's only visible when you're looking through the menus of the watch.  So, when you get your watch, charge it, and find there is no indicator, that's because you're OK, it doesn't need a charge yet.  I now have the standard battery icon in the top right of the screen.  So, I expect it'll last another day or 2, about a week on 1 charge as advertised... and I've played around with it a lot.I'm still enjoying it as much as day 1.  :)",4.0,"Convenient, efficient, discreet, and works well",1386460800,"12 8, 2013",Pebble Smartwatch for iPhone and Android (Black),149.0,Watches,"['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Smart Watches & Accessories', 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Jewelry: International Shipping Available', 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches', 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches']",,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41t32YBS8nL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B00BKEQBI0.jpg

What can the Suunto Core do for you? For starters, it can sense an approaching squall even when the sky looks clear. This intelligent Storm Alarm--one of several intelligent features designed to keep you safe and secure--is activated by a rapid drop in air pressure over a three-hour period. Once the Core senses the change, the Storm Alarm sounds and flashes, letting you know that something unpleasant is fast approaching. The built-in altimeter, meanwhile, displays your current elevation, shows how much you've climbed or descended, and records your entire session for later analysis. Accurate to within 30,000 feet, the altimeter is an extremely valuable tool for mountaineering, backcountry skiing, and wilderness travel. Add in such features as a barometer, a digital thermometer, a weather trend indicator, and a digital compass and you have a terrific wrist-top computer for almost all your outdoor needs. Additional features include several traditional watch functions, including dual times, a date display, and an alarm; predicted times for sunrise and sunset to help you maximize your daylight hours; an automatic Alti/Baro mode that senses movement or lack thereof and switches between the altimeter and barometer accordingly; a depth meter that provides accurate water depth readings to 30 feet; and the ability to function in English, German, French, and Spanish. The Suunto Core carries a two-year warranty.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BPATw66RL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B004SHUT66.jpg

There is always dew on the grass and it rains here all the time and the sneakers were always wet, smelly and caked with chicken poop and mud on the bottom.  These shoes are great!  I can slip them on when my hands are full, they are fully waterproof, they hose down when the bottoms are caked with dirt, they have a removable lining and they're pretty comfortable.  They are somewhat loose relative to the length, which is why I only gave them 4 stars.  I wear a size 8 1/2, but the 8 would have been too short.  I ordered a 9, which fits length-wise, but is pretty wide. I have a narrow foot, but I also wear an arch support so I am able to easily fit them under the removable lining to give added comfort and support to my feet.  The soles are sturdy on the stones and uneven ground in the pasture.  They seem like they will hold up well, but they are so low cost that I won't be upset if I have to buy another pair next year.

A3QJWWFT2XTLFW,B004LUXICC,Smart Cookie,"[12, 14]","Got my safety cat today. It's a tad smaller than I expected it to be, but fits nicely in the hand--any bigger and it would probably be too unwieldly. What's more, it's heavy for its size; this is a sturdy little gadget. I don't think it will ever break.I'm honestly not sure how effective this would be in a fight. It likely depends on the person using it. The main advantage of the safety cat, I think (other than discretion--who would ever guess this is a weapon?) is that you won't forget you have it on you. If, say, I carried a knife in my bag/pocket (I don't), I don't think I would have the presence of mind to dig it out in the event that I needed it. The safety cat goes on your keyring, and you carry your keys, so you constantly see it and it's constantly ready for action. All you have to do is get your fingers through the holes and PUNCH!There is no doubt in my mind that it would hurt like hell to get hit with this thing. The points on the ears aren't sharp (so you won't accidentally nick yourself) but they *might* be able to break skin with enough force behind them. Also, the description says that the ears have been strategically distanced so that they can effectively hit the eyes. I'm not sure I would have the heart to purposely get somebody in the eyes with this, even a mugger. Plus, I'm afraid I might get sued if I permanently blind somebody. (Although they won't have gotten a very good look at me, amirite?) I'm not sure of the legal status of this thing in my area, but who cares? Like I said, no one would ever guess this is a weapon. I guess I'll just have to wait to find out what the law says until after I nail somebody with it.All in all, I didn't buy this because I was looking for a serious defense weapon. I just saw it and thought, ""Wow, that's really cool! Wow, only five dollars! *BUY*"" So, shame on me. It's a great conversation piece at the very least; all my friends LOVED it and want one now. But who knows? One day it might end up saving my life. If I were a sensible girl, I might say something along the lines of, ""Gee, I hope I don't ever get the chance to test this!"" But in complete honesty... I do. I do, indeed.

The Safety Cat is a self defense, personal protection tool designed mainly for women. As women we are told for safety reasons to have our keys in our hands as we go to and from our cars. Many of us even hold our keys between our fingers walking through parking lots or out doing errands so we will be able to fight off an attacker. Unfortunately, that can be cumbersome and awkward. If you're in the position of fighting off an attacker the keys may shift in your hand making it difficult for the fight to continue. The Safety Cat self defense keychain will eliminate this problem. When holding the Safety Cat, your two fingers will be placed in the eyes of the cat and the face of the cat will rest securely in the palm of your hand. The smooth, sleek design of the Safety Cat will feel very comfortable in your hand and you will be able to grasp it firmly. Remember, the Safety Cat is used for self defense purposes only, but if you're fighting for your life the unique design of the Safety Cat is made for striking at the eyes of your attacker or attacking any fleshy part of the body.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31c0pDjvZKL.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B004LUXICC.jpg

A1E6HZD769DW5C,B001945FQU,Nomers,"[2, 2]","I have been looking at boots and my biggest complaint is how thin and low quality the fashion boots are. I took a chance and ordered these Amazon and am pleasantly surprised. The leather is firm but not overly stiff. These are fairly comfortable out of the box. If you want a good looking, casual and edgy boot...or if you actually want to ride a motorcycle ....this is a great boot.I am giving this boot five stars because based on price and description, they fit the bill. I ordered these in my normal running shoe size - 8.5. The foot fits perfectly. I will say that I have wide feet and these fit my foot so well, you'd think I ordered wide width. So keep that in mind. The shaft is liberal in the ankle and such, probably because gals with thinner legs can opt to tuck their pants in. I, however, have very muscular calves. I knew the shaft would be too narrow at the very top and I need an extra inch or so. It's not the boots that are the problem...and for not being a wide shaft boot, I'm kind of surprised I can pull these on. I can wear them with pants, but my husband does a bit of leather work and he is going to make another split on the inside of the boot so I cam get the extra inch or so. I feel it would still be worth it to keep them.I've been wearing these for about a half hour inside and I feel them easily stretching a bit so breaking them in will be easy.

And in the instance of cycling shoes, the lace-up closure of the Giro Empire Shoes is the new now. However, this isn't to say that the Empire is a novelty -- far from it. The shoes were actually designed at the behest of the young American prodigy, Taylor Phinney, for the 2012 Giro and Summer Games. The rationale behind the Empire is simple -- utilizing the versatile fit adjustment and low weight of laces provides the ultimate balance of comfort and power. When you think about it, no hook-and-loop or ratcheting buckle closure system can match the mathematical possibilities for a lace's volume customization. Through varying lacing patterns or tensions, you can customize the medial or lateral pull, or the tightness at the forefoot or instep, all at the same time. But, if you're anything like us, your first nagging thought concerns the laces getting caught in the drivetrain -- you're not alone. However, Giro's one step ahead of us, and accordingly, it incorporated a retaining lace garage on the tongue of the shoes. So, the retention system provides a positive conformity with the foot at a fraction of the typical weight. And while the Empire's laces are an obvious differentiator, so are its other design features. Starting at the uppers themselves, Giro wrapped the Empire with one-piece of Tejin microfiber. This contributes to the shoes' sleek profile, but it also reduces weight while the fabric selection increases breathability. That's right, the Japanese Tejin fabric is extremely lightweight and highly breathable. Furthermore, Giro placed focused points of perforation along the Empire's sides and tongue in order to increase airflow throughout the shoe. And in case it gets a little sweaty inside, the Empire also features an X-Static footbed that's anti-microbial, anti-stink, and anti-static.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41kkBCYG2sL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B00984YN6Q.jpg

One by one these things have stopped being waterproof.At first they are fantastic (thus, the number of them that we own).  The features are great and they are waterproof - for a while.  None of these has ever been abused, just worn and never in water deeper than 10 feet (a mere 3.3 meters).  One of them, worn into a swimming pool, came out full of water and completely non-functional.  Fortunately it was under warranty, but it still cost $7 to have repaired/replaced.  Two others are older than one year, but less than two, and have started becoming foggy after swimming (pool, not ocean).  The fog evaporates after an hour or so, indicating that water can not only get in, but that it can get out.  The last is only six months old and fine so far, but I do not expect it to last much longer--it too will likely leak just after the warranty expires.For the cost of these things and the claim that they are ""waterproof to 100 m,"" they are incredibly unreliable long-term.",2.0,Waterproof only for a limited period of time.,1214784000,"06 30, 2008",Timex Women's T59201 Ironman 50-Lap Triathlon Sleek Resin Strap Watch,42.0,Watches,"['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches']","About Timex Timex Corporation is the nation's leading watch manufacturer.

On the plus side it is about two-hundred dollars less than Dynamic's and it rides nice enough.  On the negative side, it is a little heavier than Dynamic's and Sonoma uses poor quality parts.  Like the brake handles and cables are very cheap and of poor quality.  The large bearing at the top of the fork is rough and it was originally so tight that it was difficult to turn the wheel.  I had to re-adjust it.  The gear shift cable needed to be adjusted in order to get the gears to shift smoothly and there wasn't any grease on the drive gear at the back wheel.  The tube in the front tire was pinched between the wheel and the tire, putting a big hole in it.  Had to replace the tube.  I don't know yet how well the bike will hold up, since I just got it all together today.  I really like the chainless drive system, but the rest of the bike is nothing special and in fact looks and feels rather cheap.

Specifically engineered to make navigating urban or suburban environments simpler and safer, the Urban Voyager also includes an ergonomically designed seat that helps you stay comfortable on long rides, adjustable alloy handlebars, ergonomically designed hand grips, pull-lever front and rear alloy brakes, and a shock-absorbing suspension fork that ensures a smoother, more controlled ride.The bike's chainless D-Drive system eliminates the trouble-causing chain and derailleur.Sonoma's Chainless D-Drive SystemIt's the low-maintenance chainless design that really stands out, however. Powering the newest trend in chainless bicycling, the chainless D-Drive system replaces the parts of a bike that cause the most problems--the chain and derailleur. In their place, the D-Drive system uses a drive shaft with a fully enclosed bevel gear system to transmit power from the bike pedals to the rear wheel. Shimano internal gears within the rear wheel help the system run smoothly and quietly while optimizing pedal efficiency. At the same time, the Shimano ""twist and go"" gear system is responsive and easy to use, so you can shift with the flick of a finger.The chainless D-Drive system offers a number of benefits over traditional chain bikes. In addition to delivering a much quieter ride, it keeps you from ruining your favorite clothes while riding to work or getting grease all over your hands while fixing a slipped chain. The D-Drive system is also protected from external elements, so it doesn't require the ongoing cleaning, lubrication, and checkups that a chain-drive bike typically requires. And the internal drive shaft is less likely to sustain damage from falls and road debris, giving it a significantly longer life than a chain. In fact, the D-Drive system carries a warranty that lasts for the life of your bike. Once you experience Sonoma's exclusive D-Drive chainless system, you may never want to ride a chain-driven bicycle again.Other features include built-in water bottle mounts, a convenient rear carrier rack, and 700c Kenda city tread tires and tubes. Best of all, everything on the bike is backed by either a two-year or lifetime warranty. The Sonoma Urban Voyager is available in a light satin sky color with subtle grey accents.The bright Shimano auto-light system includes a Xenon bulb.Riders will love the convenient rear carrier rack.SpecificationsColor: Light satin sky with grey accentsFrame size: 19 inchesWheel size: 28 inchesFrame: Lightweight 6000 series aluminum with water bottle mountsSaddle: Cionlli dual fabric commuter saddleHandlebars: Alloy with adjustable stemFork: RST SOFI ML suspension with mechanical lockout systemFenders: Quick-release front and rearHub: Shimano Nexus Inter 7 (rear), 7-speed sealed gear hubShifter: Shimano Nexus Revoshift 7-speedBrakes: Front and rear alloy V-brakes with alloy hand pull leversOperating system: D-Drive chainlessRims: 700c double-wall alloySeat post: Alloy with quick-release lever adjustmentRack: Alloy rear rack with Sonoma signature storage bagTires: 700c Kenda city tread tires and tubesPedals: Plastic platform, 9/16 inches, with CPSC reflectorsGrips: Anatomically designed dual-densityStand-over height: 25-1/2 inchesWarranties: Lifetime on frame, fork, and D-Drive system, 2 years on all other componentsAbout Dynacraft BicyclesDynacraft brings families together by providing affordable, high-quality bicycles for everyone in the family, no matter their age.

ACCNL8QFOZRLN,B00BKEQBI0,"J. Bartlett ""Huge Fan of Amazon""","[4, 4]","Just got the Pebble this morning.  Setup was a breeze with my iPhone running iOS 7.  I read most of the reviews here on Amazon before buying the watch, and it looks like some of the doubters either received defective Pebbles or were just plain wrong.  The high points:Build Quality - my Pebble has no discernible manufacturing defects in the watch casing, as some others have observed with their Pebbles.  If you bought a Pebble from Amazon and there are nicks, scratches, or other defects in the watch casing, just send it back and get another one.  That's why we buy from Amazon people.  Easy returns and exchanges.Setup - I am into tech, but I did not have to draw on any serious knowledge of technology to set this thing up.  The Pebble folks have done a great job in making sure users are spoon-fed by the Pebble app and the watch during setup.  It.Was.Easy.Exchange Notifications - I read in some other reviews that users were upset that the Pebble purportedly does not receive email notifications from Microsoft Exchange accounts.  This is simply not true if you are using an iPhone running iOS 7.  I am receiving my work emails (Exchange server) just fine.  I do not have an Android phone, so if there is a problem there, I leave that to someone else to address.  But as to reviews claiming that iPhones with iOS 7 cannot receive Microsoft Exchange email notifications, THEY ARE FLAT OUT WRONG.Strap - I ordered a nicer replacement strap when I ordered my Pebble.  Replacing the strap was incredibly easy, and all I had to do was Google ""replace Pebble watch strap"" and view a short video.  The watch looks much nicer with the replacement strap.Slickwrap - I also ordered an Onyx brushed metal wrap for my Pebble.  Application took a little while to get right, but it was worth it.  Makes the watch look great.  IMPORTANT - the Slickwrap came with a screen protector film, which is a MUST with the Pebble.  The Pebble has a plastic screen that is very prone to scratching.  Applying a screen protector should be pretty much the first thing you do with your Pebble.I love the Pebble so far because it is exactly what I expected it to be - a device to, among other things, receive notifications from my iPhone and control my iPhone's music.  With the coming 2.0 firmware update, the watch is going to be able to do even more than that.  Right now I am running the SmartModernMod - Button Mod watch face from MyPebbleFaces.com, and it is very cool.  Weather, calendar, notifications, music control, etc.If you are looking for a second smartphone to wear on your wrist, then the Pebble is not for you.  That said, even now, Pebble does a lot more than just provide smartphone notifications, and the 2.0 firmware update is going to open things up for exciting developments in the future.  I am also looking forward to the GoPro Pebble app, as I have used my GoPro to video my younger son's tournament baseball games for years, and since I also manage his team, this will make it easier to turn the camera on and off between innings and let me focus on the game.In short, read the reviews, watch the videos, and read the information on Pebble's website.  If all of that describes a smartwatch that fits your needs and desires, then you will not be disappointing.",5.0,I love my Pebble,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",Pebble Smartwatch for iPhone and Android (Black),149.0,Watches,"['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Smart Watches & Accessories', 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Jewelry: International Shipping Available', 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches', 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches']",,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41t32YBS8nL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B00BKEQBI0.jpg

I was surprised by it being so deeply discounted being such a recent launch.After a couple of weeks using it I can see why.They propose a simple, no gimmick, product. The problem is that the user interface simply makes no sense.First, you have to active the GPS on every mode you use it. For instance, if you hold a button for a couple of seconds, it reads ""GPS ON"" but then you go to Bike mode and it blinks ""Indoor"", so you have to turn it on again (and every time you go to bike mode).As an occasional rider, I just want to know my speed and how much I rode. I assumed it would start measuring both automatically and pause when I stop. It doesn't.You have to go to the Chrono mode, start the chronograph, then go back to Bike mode and start the GPS again.Given that the GPS seems to turn itself off so often, I assumed that I didn't need to do anything once I was done riding my bike. Wrong again.The battery completely depleted in about 24 hours. I searched a forum and they said I had to hold the button that turns the GPS on/off for a couple of seconds so it turns itself off. By doing this, now it lasts many days in stand by mode.And also the manual is almost useless.How could they make something they claim to be simple so complicated?They have the chance to solve these issues, and improve the unit, with firmware updates.

I can check the news with rss feeds with my pebble, the weather, it's water proof, I can change my music, set timers and alarms. I never have to buy an actual battery for it since you charge the watch like a phone. Although, I had to buy a charger for it since the watch itself did not come with one. I also love how you can change the face of the watches as many times as you want. I currently have 3 games on it too, like some worm game, etch-e-sketch (pebble-sketch) and Pong.All around this is a great watch. If I had to give one complaint I would say that when you are switching between watch faces, the watch numbers get small and kind of stop until the watch resets itself with is not all the time but it does happen from time to time. The reset can take a min.

Not only is it super light, but Timex has done a simply brilliant job with the band.- The numbers are big and easy to read- The backlighting works well- The watch looks good- Having an extra time zone available at the push of a button is a major convenienceHowever... The buttons are very sensitive and not recessed so if you are active, or wear the watch while sleeping, you may find it switched to a different mode. I've awoken to find the watch showing Japan time and looked down while doing an obstacle course to see the watch had switched itself to a countdown mode.I wanted to love the Ironman but ended up returning it and getting aCasio Men's DW5600E-1V G-Shock Classic Digital Watch, a roughly comparable watch. The G-Shock is $10 more, lacks the two time zones, has smaller (though perfectly legible numbers) and wasn't as immediately comfortable as the Timex. However, its buttons are recessed and stiff so there is little chance it will put itself into the wrong mode, and I get the sense that it is a generally more solid, shock and wear resistant watch.

Using an old wetsuit and some sharp scissors, he made the first pair of eyewear retainers. The ingenious device was based on the design of a Chinese finger trap, and quickly became a hit with local ski patrolers. Demand picked up quickly for the patrolman's invention, which was initially nameless. Back in the seventies, the Jackson Hole ski patrol used the nickname ""croakies"" when they couldn't think of a word (think ""thing- amajig""), but it finally stuck on the world'd first neoprene eyewear retainer.Croakies headquarters are still in Jackson Hole, with production in Bozeman, Montana. The inspiration remains the same -- to create eyewear retainers and accessories that provide comfort, style, durability, and functionality to active people of all ages. Croakies products are sold by retailers throughout the United States and in over 30 countries around the world.

Regardless of your excursion--whether it's climbing mountains, riding a muddy bike track, or skiing off piste--you need accurate, real-time information about your surroundings to pull off a successful trip. The X-Lander contributes by not only providing important data, but also keeping track of your activities so you can make rational decisions at key moments. In addition, the watch is user-friendly and solidly built, with a non-allergenic aluminum casing, a carbon-fiber back, a durable mineral crystal glass, and a water-resistant fabric strap.The built-in altimeter, which boasts a range of up to 29,500 feet, puts all 14 of the world's 8,000-plus-meter summits within the avid climber's range. Among the altimeter's functions are an altitude measurement function that lets you follow the vertical progress between stages, an automatic 24-hour memory that stores the altitude and ascent/decent rate for every hour, and an adjustable altitude alarm. Climbers will also dig the logbook function, which lets you record total and cumulative vertical ascents and descents as well as the number of runs skied.The X-Lander also displays the current barometric pressure and temperature--a must for activities in which weather plays a factor. The device automatically records barometric data for the previous four days, with the first six hours manifested in one-hour intervals and the rest in six-hour intervals. When the reference altitude is set correctly, the instrument also displays the present sea level pressure, which makes it easier to read and understand the barometric pressure at high altitudes.And few things are more important when exploring unfamiliar territory than a compass. The X-Lander's electronic compass contributes by guiding you with cardinal or half- cardinal points and a North-South arrow. The compass can also be set to track a certain bearing, which helps you follow a chosen direction. Meanwhile, the unit's declination adjustment function allows you to correct the difference between true North and magnetic North.In addition to the variety of outdoor functions, the X-Lander also displays normal time, with such add-ons as three daily alarms, a calendar programmed to the year 2089, a stopwatch with split-time measurement, and a countdown timer. Other features include a durable negative LCD display, a user-replaceable battery, and water-resistance to 100 feet. The X-Lander is backed by a two-year warranty on parts and labor.What's in the Box?X-Lander wrist-top computer, battery, user's manual.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RpfJIscTL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B000051SEP.jpg

Regardless of your excursion--whether it's climbing mountains, riding a muddy bike track, or skiing off piste--you need accurate, real-time information about your surroundings to pull off a successful trip. The X-Lander contributes by not only providing important data, but also keeping track of your activities so you can make rational decisions at key moments. In addition, the watch is user-friendly and solidly built, with a non-allergenic aluminum casing, a carbon-fiber back, a durable mineral crystal glass, and a water-resistant fabric strap.The built-in altimeter, which boasts a range of up to 29,500 feet, puts all 14 of the world's 8,000-plus-meter summits within the avid climber's range. Among the altimeter's functions are an altitude measurement function that lets you follow the vertical progress between stages, an automatic 24-hour memory that stores the altitude and ascent/decent rate for every hour, and an adjustable altitude alarm. Climbers will also dig the logbook function, which lets you record total and cumulative vertical ascents and descents as well as the number of runs skied.The X-Lander also displays the current barometric pressure and temperature--a must for activities in which weather plays a factor. The device automatically records barometric data for the previous four days, with the first six hours manifested in one-hour intervals and the rest in six-hour intervals. When the reference altitude is set correctly, the instrument also displays the present sea level pressure, which makes it easier to read and understand the barometric pressure at high altitudes.And few things are more important when exploring unfamiliar territory than a compass. The X-Lander's electronic compass contributes by guiding you with cardinal or half- cardinal points and a North-South arrow. The compass can also be set to track a certain bearing, which helps you follow a chosen direction. Meanwhile, the unit's declination adjustment function allows you to correct the difference between true North and magnetic North.In addition to the variety of outdoor functions, the X-Lander also displays normal time, with such add-ons as three daily alarms, a calendar programmed to the year 2089, a stopwatch with split-time measurement, and a countdown timer. Other features include a durable negative LCD display, a user-replaceable battery, and water-resistance to 100 feet. The X-Lander is backed by a two-year warranty on parts and labor.What's in the Box?X-Lander wrist-top computer, battery, user's manual.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RpfJIscTL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B000051SEP.jpg

Using an old wetsuit and some sharp scissors, he made the first pair of eyewear retainers. The ingenious device was based on the design of a Chinese finger trap, and quickly became a hit with local ski patrolers. Demand picked up quickly for the patrolman's invention, which was initially nameless. Back in the seventies, the Jackson Hole ski patrol used the nickname ""croakies"" when they couldn't think of a word (think ""thing- amajig""), but it finally stuck on the world'd first neoprene eyewear retainer.Croakies headquarters are still in Jackson Hole, with production in Bozeman, Montana. The inspiration remains the same -- to create eyewear retainers and accessories that provide comfort, style, durability, and functionality to active people of all ages.

A1AYBKV6DO2389,B00BKEQBI0,Mr. Smarty,"[2, 5]","My sister bought me this watch for my birthday, about three months ago.  Since then I have been able to use it for a total of 3 weeks.  For starters, even while it worked, it was extremely buggy - frequently dropping its connection to my phone, randomly dropping texts - totally unreliable for anything other than telling the time.  The battery life is that of a gadget - not a phone.  You can get a few days without having to charge it.  In my occupation, timing is everything and having a watch die in the middle of a shift is a disaster.  I could not use it at work for that reason.  Finally, to add insult to injury, the watch stopped taking a charge after about 3 weeks of use.  This is where the real problems started.Pebble customer service is about as bad as any you could possibly imagine.  There seems to be a mandatory 2-week holding period before they will respond to any email for support.  When they respond, it is usually with unhelpful responses that do not resolve the problem, then requiring an additional 2-week delay for the next unhelpful response.  They finally concluded that my cable must be bad, after requiring me to jump through hoops like sending them photos of the phone and such.  After a few more 2-week waits the new cable arrives - surprise!  Still does not work.  Now another 2-week wait, probably more requests for documentation, pictures, etc...  I'm done with pebble and I am requesting a refund, that I'll have to wait at least another month or so for I would guess, if I even get one at all.This watch was never ready to go on sale.  Pebble does not seem to have the desire or capacity to deal with the problems.

Rosewarne,"[0, 0]","This watch was great while it lasted, but be warned, the bezel will fall off and SURPRISE it turns out that this is not covered under the warranty. Designed in Finland, but made in China and it shows and it is clear to me exactly why it is not covered under the warranty.I should have known better from the start since 30M water resistance on something that is being marketed as 'military' is a joke. Military in this instance just refers to the black coloring/cosmetics and only serves to support the fashion aspect of it as some kind of mil-spec piece of equipment, which I can assure you it is not. I have dive watches, so this wouldn't have been used in the water that way and so I purchased it anyway......much to my dismay.The watch was decent while it lasted, it just didn't last that long. So much for Suunto 'sports' watches. Their image as a maker of high quality outdoor gear type stuff is all just a marketing ploy and has no real basis in their products or their support for their products. They are just big fashion accessories for people that want to look outdoorsy.I snowboard, mountain bike, dive, windsurf, trek, surf, climb, camp and pretty much do everything you can do outdoors and so when it came time to get a new watch, a Suunto was an obvious option. At $350 the X-Lander Military seemed it would be a ruggedly built watch and be able to stand up to that kind of use pretty well. Wrong.The first thing that went after about 4 mos. was the loop part of the watch band that holds down the extra strap portion when it is on your wrist, so that it was always sticking up. Rather than buying a new band, I just started using my girlfriend's black hairband/rubber bands for that and it worked better than the original part. The band that comes with this watch is just cheap plastic, plan on getting a different one if you buy the watch. I wish I had just returned the watch at that point.I typically only used the watch when doing stuff outdoors b/c it is too bulky for regular daily wear, so I imagine it was used maybe 50-60 days in a little under 2 years. One day, while not doing anything too taxing (driving actually), the face bezel just falls off. I snap it back on and was thankful that it didn't come off and get lost. The next time it came off, it did get lost.No problem, I assume that Suunto would have an adequate warranty and being used to dealing with companies like North Face, Patagonia and REI all the time, I assumed they would stand by their product. Wrong again. Suunto is NOT like that.I called Suunto and was informed that the warranty DOES NOT COVER the face bezel falling off. Huh? The customer service rep informs me that these are connected when they leave the factory and therefore not covered b/c they are not supposed to come off (I responded with 'that much we can agree on, they should not come off). He then goes on to tell me that it will be at least $90 to send it to them to fix it, because they have to also replace the inner metal casing part of the face. Again, huh? $90 for what would be about $7 (if that, they make the damn things after all) in parts and perhaps 30 minutes of labor? Are you kidding me?I bought a Tag Heuer Kirium watch back in 1999 and I took that everywhere and did EVERYTHING with it for years, including diving and that included a 2 year stint backpacking throughout South America and all manner of outdoor adventures and that thing has never skipped a beat. Ever. And it isn't even a sports watch AND I still wear it constantly for regular use.I told Suunto customer service person there is no way I'm going to waste $90 fixing what turns out to be just a BIG WATCH fashion accessory when they can't even guarantee me the bezel won't just fall off again and will just leave it in the gear bag as a semi-functioning backup.They won't post my review on their website for obvious reasons, so that should tell you a lot about how much they care about their customers right there.",1.0,"Initially a great watch, until it fell apart that is",1392768000,"02 19, 2014","Suunto X-Lander Wrist-Top Computer Watch with Altimeter, Barometer, Compass, and Chronograph",329.0,Watches,"['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches']","The ultimate option for the outdoor enthusiast, the silver Suunto X-Lander wrist-top computer offers an accurate altimeter, a complete barometer, a precise electronic compass, and a multifunction sports watch in a single elegant package. Regardless of your excursion--whether it's climbing mountains, riding a muddy bike track, or skiing off piste--you need accurate, real-time information about your surroundings to pull off a successful trip. The X-Lander contributes by not only providing important data, but also keeping track of your activities so you can make rational decisions at key moments. In addition, the watch is user-friendly and solidly built, with a non-allergenic aluminum casing, a carbon-fiber back, a durable mineral crystal glass, and a water-resistant fabric strap.The built-in altimeter, which boasts a range of up to 29,500 feet, puts all 14 of the world's 8,000-plus-meter summits within the avid climber's range. Among the altimeter's functions are an altitude measurement function that lets you follow the vertical progress between stages, an automatic 24-hour memory that stores the altitude and ascent/decent rate for every hour, and an adjustable altitude alarm. Climbers will also dig the logbook function, which lets you record total and cumulative vertical ascents and descents as well as the number of runs skied.The X-Lander also displays the current barometric pressure and temperature--a must for activities in which weather plays a factor. The device automatically records barometric data for the previous four days, with the first six hours manifested in one-hour intervals and the rest in six-hour intervals. When the reference altitude is set correctly, the instrument also displays the present sea level pressure, which makes it easier to read and understand the barometric pressure at high altitudes.And few things are more important when exploring unfamiliar territory than a compass. The X-Lander's electronic compass contributes by guiding you with cardinal or half- cardinal points and a North-South arrow. The compass can also be set to track a certain bearing, which helps you follow a chosen direction. Meanwhile, the unit's declination adjustment function allows you to correct the difference between true North and magnetic North.In addition to the variety of outdoor functions, the X-Lander also displays normal time, with such add-ons as three daily alarms, a calendar programmed to the year 2089, a stopwatch with split-time measurement, and a countdown timer. Other features include a durable negative LCD display, a user-replaceable battery, and water-resistance to 100 feet. The X-Lander is backed by a two-year warranty on parts and labor.What's in the Box?X-Lander wrist-top computer, battery, user's manual.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RpfJIscTL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B000051SEP.jpg

The cutting-edge performance watch includes everything a sports watch needs, including an oversized display, a huge lap memory feature, a training log, and a Target Time Pacer. As a result, you'll have an edge when training for your next sprint, distance run, or triathlon. The mid-size watch's primary distinguishing feature is its TapScreen technology, which helps you keep your eyes on the trail while you run or cycle. When TapScreen is active, a simple tap anywhere on the watch face will activate the lap timers, so you don't have to fiddle with a bunch of buttons to get to the proper screen. In a sport in which every second counts, the TapScreen function is a vital tool. The watch also includes a convenient Indiglo night mode, which makes early-morning and late-night training even easier. By holding down the Indigo button for three seconds, the watch face will automatically illuminate each time you press any button.Athletes who want to monitor their workout progress can turn to the watch's Lap Management System, which stores multiple workouts by date. The system keeps records of every lap/split and target time, along with records for your best lap and average lap speed. It also automatically stores workouts from the chronograph, letting you recall, for example, 150 one-lap workouts, one 150-lap workout, or anything in between. Perhaps the most important feature, however, is the Target Time Pacer. This feature helps you maintain your desired pace in a workout or race, so you can achieve your overall time goal. With every lap or distance segment, the watch provides audible and visual alerts to indicate whether your pace per lap is too slow, too fast, or on target. Without even a glance at your watch, you'll hear whether you're on track to meet your goal. As a bonus, the Lap Management System also recalls workout information from the Target Time Pacer, showing how much faster or slower you ran each lap and calculating your total workout time.Other features include a 24-hour countdown timer; three interval programs, each with up to 16 interval timers with user-selectable interval labels; three alarms, with daily, weekday, weekend, and day-of-week setting options; an easy-to-read display with three lines of text; open vents in the strap to minimize skin contact and increase breathability; and hydration and nutrition alarms, which remind you to refuel at regular intervals to top up essential reserves.SpecificationsChronograph: 100 hours, with lap and split timesMemory recall: 150 lapsOn-the-fly lap or split recall: YesLap counter: 199 lapsCountdown timer: 24 hours, with stop and repeatInterval timers: 16, with repeatAutomatic interval repetition counter: YesAlarms: 3 daily, weekly, weekday, or weekendTime zones: 2Case: ResinStrap: Co-molded resinWater-resistance: 100 meters",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TNWWy9jLL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B0035XS1J6.jpg

Composed of 100 percent New Zealand merino wool, the Icebreaker Bodyfit260 line takes high-tech, high-performance sport clothing back to nature with its natural fiber construction. A base layer in cold conditions, and a standalone during high aerobic activities and in warmer temperatures, the Bodyfit 260 Mid-weight Tech Top is highly breathable, will not hold odors, and offers maximum warmth with great temperature regulation for high-performance comfort.Icebreaker uses the best superfine merino in the world, from the mountains of New Zealand. In contrast to synthetics, the Icebreaker merino fabric is finer, softer, more insulating, and more breathable than alternative fabric types. The lightweight, odor-resistant, and soft-against-the-skin fabric breathes better than other garments because each individual merino fiber breathes as well as the fabric, allowing your body to release moisture vapor so that you never feel clammy.The Bodyfit260 Mid-weight Tech Top has a three-way collar that will zip up to a high neck, zip down for cooling, or roll over. A slim fit offers a form-flattering look and flat seams provide zero-abrasion comfort. The all-natural merino fabric features a circular knit that offers a natural stretch that will maintain its shape over years of use. With a dropped tail and thumb loops the shirt will stay in place even through the most rigorous activities. Easy to care for, the Mid-weight Tech Top is machine washable and fast drying. Additionally, the Bodyfit260 fabric will not absorb odors as synthetic fabrics do.Specifications:Base layer100 percent New Zealand merino wool260g/m2 ColdCircular knit with natural stretchRaglan long sleevesHigh neckThree-way collar (zip up, down, or up and rolled)Thumb loopsDropped tailFlat seamsBreathableOdor freeSize Specifications:X-Small: Bust 33 inches; height 62.5 inchesSmall: Bust 35 inches; height 64 inchesMedium: Bust 37 inches; height 66 inchesLarge: Bust 39 inches; height 67.5 inchesX-Large: Bust 40.5 inches; height 69 inchesCare Specifications:Icebreaker garments almost look after themselves because they don't hold moisture or odor. In fact, the known record for wearing an Icebreaker non-stop is 196 days in extreme conditions. Here are a few tips to get the best out of your Icebreaker.Use warm or cool machine-wash on normal cycleWash separately first (after 2 to 3 days use) to remove any loose fibersWash with like colorsWash on a normal cycle with other hard fabrics to remove fluffingNever use a fabric softenerDo not use detergents with bleachDo not tumble dry--dry flat in the shade or on the clotheslineAbout Icebreaker Merino WoolIcebreaker uses the best superfine merino in the world, from the mountains of New Zealand in all of its garments. Icebreaker's merino fiber was created by nature to protect animals in the harsh environment of New Zealand's Southern Alps. If the fiber didn't work, the animals wouldn't survive. Recognizing that it couldn't design a better fiber, Icebreaker turned nature's merino wool into a clothing system for humans. In contrast to synthetics, Icebreaker merino is 100 percent natural. The fabric created is finer, softer, more insulating, and more breathable than alternative fabric types.Icebreaker merino forms a buffer zone around your body, keeping you at an ideal temperature in all climates and conditions. It's also lightweight, odor-resistant and soft against the skin--all qualities that will help you to perform at your peak. Because Icebreaker merino fibers are so fine, they are naturally more breathable, so you stay cool in the hottest conditions. It feels very different than synthetics, where breathability is limited.Icebreaker garments breath better than other garments because each individual merino fiber breathes as well as the fabric allowing your body to release moisture vapor so that you never feel clammy. In a warm, high aerobic environment, sweat is pulled from the body into the fabric, and dispersed and metabolized as moisture vapor through the outside of the garment, cooling the body through evaporation. In cold temperatures, when moisture is absorbed from the cold air, Icebreaker merino fibers liberate heat through a molecular process call ""heat of sorption"" to keep you warm.Manufacturer Warranty1-year warranty",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GxXM9LRFL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B001F50H48.jpg

When I got home and opened the box, I waited for the foul smell to come out but it never did. There wasn't the tiniest bit of odor on the fabric. The pockets are reasonably sized and nearly all of my stuff fit into them perfectly. Also, some people were complaining about their cellphones not being able to fit. I have an iPhone (which are pretty wide, plus it has a case) and it fit in the pockets perfectly as well. The only thing that was hard to put in a pocket was a water bottle, but once I finally did put it in there, I was able to take it out and put it back in without any trouble. I don't know how often I'll be putting a water bottle in there, so I'm not too worried. Overall, it's a great product!

The Safety Cat is a self defense, personal protection tool designed mainly for women. As women we are told for safety reasons to have our keys in our hands as we go to and from our cars. Many of us even hold our keys between our fingers walking through parking lots or out doing errands so we will be able to fight off an attacker. Unfortunately, that can be cumbersome and awkward. If you're in the position of fighting off an attacker the keys may shift in your hand making it difficult for the fight to continue. The Safety Cat self defense keychain will eliminate this problem. When holding the Safety Cat, your two fingers will be placed in the eyes of the cat and the face of the cat will rest securely in the palm of your hand. The smooth, sleek design of the Safety Cat will feel very comfortable in your hand and you will be able to grasp it firmly. Remember, the Safety Cat is used for self defense purposes only, but if you're fighting for your life the unique design of the Safety Cat is made for striking at the eyes of your attacker or attacking any fleshy part of the body.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31c0pDjvZKL.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B004LUXICC.jpg

Decided to go with a Polar brand watch for a change (11/2013) and was very, very disappointed with its lack of functionality and extremely clumsy interface.  Discarded after one week of use and decided to go back to Timex, but this time with the T5K736.  Even though the T5K736 lacks some of the sophistication of its bigger cousin, the watch does the job and has worked flawlessly to date --- I have no complaints.  I use it for marathon training, so the features I am interested in are these:  HR, avg HR for the workout, time-in-zone, lap splits (with avg HR per split), and total caloric burn.  I love the sensor system with the soft chest strap and snap on/off transmitter.  The single biggest difference between the Ironman watch and the T5K736 is that the former can remember up to three workouts, whereas the T5K736 only keeps track of the one just completed, so if you forget to record your workout --- before starting another --- your biometrics are lost.I would definitely --- without hesitation --- buy this watch again and recommend it to anyone who is interested in simple heart rate training.",5.0,Met My Expectations Perfectly,1389484800,"01 12, 2014",Timex Men's Zone Trainer Digital HRM Flex Tech Chest Strap &amp; Full-Size Watch,68.82,Watches,"['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches']",Take your training further with the Timex Ironman Zone Trainer digital heart rate monitor.

When you give each foot the Men's Rapa Nui 2 Trail Running Shoe from Hoka One One, you'll be bounding along the trail long after your running club has gone home, showered, and started in on their second evening cocktail. This funny-looking footwear is a dream to run on--with 1. 5 times the EVA volume that average running shoes have, every footfall is sweeter than the last. Made from air mesh, the upper lets fresh air tickle your tootsies without letting your foot flop around inside the shoe. From the tips of your little piggies to the very end of your heel, Hoka's proprietary midsole, HIR IMEVA, absorbs the shock of impact so all you feel is a sweet, soft cushion while trail-tromping. The 5mm heel-toe drop isn't minimal but isn't an elevated experience, either. The Balanced Stage Meta-Rocker Geometry keeps your foot rolling in the right direction without wasting energy on wiggles or wobbles or something in between. The bottom sports Full Ground Contact Design, which is as it sounds. The full length of your foot, plus a bit on the sides, stays in touch with the earth. Your gait isn't shaky and any kinks get a bit of correction. High-abrasion rubber is molded into dirt-gnawing 4mm multi-directional lugs. This robust sole endures the test of time without letting you slip and slide over uncertain terrain. Even if you have a chunk of concrete to cover before you hit the dusty (or muddy) trail, the Rapa Nui 2 is the shoe for you.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4188I1ETiuL._SX300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B00E0MB3ZK.jpg

Compass and Altimeter very accurate. Excellent tool for trekking in the Laguna San Rafael National Park. My only critisism is the Barometer that makes weather prediction a bit awkward and it's size. It's a bit big to fit under gloves/jacket sleeves. Anyway, a very useful tool. B.T.W: Wesley Fine...

Regardless of your excursion--whether it's climbing mountains, riding a muddy bike track, or skiing off piste--you need accurate, real-time information about your surroundings to pull off a successful trip. The X-Lander contributes by not only providing important data, but also keeping track of your activities so you can make rational decisions at key moments. In addition, the watch is user-friendly and solidly built, with a non-allergenic aluminum casing, a carbon-fiber back, a durable mineral crystal glass, and a water-resistant fabric strap.The built-in altimeter, which boasts a range of up to 29,500 feet, puts all 14 of the world's 8,000-plus-meter summits within the avid climber's range. Among the altimeter's functions are an altitude measurement function that lets you follow the vertical progress between stages, an automatic 24-hour memory that stores the altitude and ascent/decent rate for every hour, and an adjustable altitude alarm. Climbers will also dig the logbook function, which lets you record total and cumulative vertical ascents and descents as well as the number of runs skied.The X-Lander also displays the current barometric pressure and temperature--a must for activities in which weather plays a factor. The device automatically records barometric data for the previous four days, with the first six hours manifested in one-hour intervals and the rest in six-hour intervals. When the reference altitude is set correctly, the instrument also displays the present sea level pressure, which makes it easier to read and understand the barometric pressure at high altitudes.And few things are more important when exploring unfamiliar territory than a compass. The X-Lander's electronic compass contributes by guiding you with cardinal or half- cardinal points and a North-South arrow. The compass can also be set to track a certain bearing, which helps you follow a chosen direction. Meanwhile, the unit's declination adjustment function allows you to correct the difference between true North and magnetic North.In addition to the variety of outdoor functions, the X-Lander also displays normal time, with such add-ons as three daily alarms, a calendar programmed to the year 2089, a stopwatch with split-time measurement, and a countdown timer. Other features include a durable negative LCD display, a user-replaceable battery, and water-resistance to 100 feet. The X-Lander is backed by a two-year warranty on parts and labor.What's in the Box?X-Lander wrist-top computer, battery, user's manual.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RpfJIscTL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B000051SEP.jpg

You can use it to turn your favorite pair of high heels into dance shoes or to replace the worn-out suede soles of your existing dance shoes.Stick-on suede soles from Soles2dance provide ideal friction properties for dancing on well-maintained and clean wood dance floors. This innovative and unique product differs from conventional do-it-yourself add-on suede patches in that Soles2dance soles come with industrial-strength adhesive backing. You only have to peel off the protective foil from the backing and stick the soles onto your existing shoes . Other add-on suede sole products without adhesive backing require you to glue the soles on -- a messy and tricky procedure. You also have to buy that glue and learn how to apply it properly. None of that is necessary with our stick-on soles with industrial-strength adhesive backing.Will these soles stay on?After extensive testing and after having sold more than 1000 units of this and similar stick-on suede sole products with the same adhesive, we know with certainty that the adhesive stays on when used on shoes with hard leather or suede soles. On the vast majority of rubber or plastic-soled shoes the adhesive also stays on, but there are some very rare rubber or plastic compounds (notably a synthetic, rubber-like plastic material called EVA), to which the adhesive sticks less well. Fewer than 1% of our customers reported such problems. In the unlikely case that this product does not stick well to your shoes, please contact us. We respond promptly and will provide you with a satisfactory solution. Guaranteed! Chances of detachment increase when you use rubber-soled shoes with aggressive profiles that present only a small surface area for the adhesive to touch.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rY2pojSjL._SX300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B00CBL4LD8.jpg

Parts of the body and organs lie in these zones.It is believed by all reflexologists that the sole of the foot mirrors the body, with the left foot reflecting the left side of the body and the right foot the right side. Hence, it is deduced that pressing the sole in the opposite place will cause an advantageous effect to be felt in the respective part of the body.As mentioned, a perceptive area in the foot indicates a problem in the consequent organ in the body. Pressing on the appropriate trouble-spot can be an effective way of relieving pain and helping to restore the body's natural balance. It can also reduce stress, improve circulation, accelerate metabolism and revitalize energy levels.By wearing the sandals you can effectively resuscitate your organs and keep them healthy, not to mention augmenting the circulation in the feet and legs, easing exhaustion and helping to alleviate the uneasiness of tired, aching feetIn order to stimulate these reflex points in your feet, reflexology shoes and sandals have been introduced. Reflexology Sandals were created so that people can be capable of giving themselves this type of therapy effortlessly and inexpensively.This is achieved with the massage nodules on these sandals. They are raised to follow the contour of the feet. The pegs basically stimulate the reflex area when one wears the sandals and  are removable, so that you may customize the sandals to target specific pressure points.A number of people begin by wearing these shoes for only five minutes in the beginning and then progressively increase the periods, for example while doing the dishes or while talking on the phone. Make sure that you do not wear these sandals all day long as they are only meant to be worn for short periods of time to stimulate your reflexology points.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518zWeUwkJL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B001EO010A.jpg

However, the software is completely dodgy and unreliable.  After a couple of days, emails were no longer showing up on the watch.  A few days later, texts disappeared.  Then, the charger blew up (my computer actually ejected it with an error message that said the USB device was using too much power).  After days of no longer being able to charge my watch, it simply died.  I tried to recharge it with someone else's charger but it was too late.  It's dead Jim.  And so apparently is Pebble's customer service which has ignored all of my attempts to contact them.  These guys are obviously in over their heads, being completely unprepared for the demand for their ""amazing"" new product that clearly was not ready for prime time.  Save your money and wait for the iWatch.Update:  I finally heard from customer service (so they do exist).  They are overnighting a charger to me via Fed Ex.  Also, after trying to charge the phone again with my friend's charger, I pushed all of the buttons randomly and finally my phone came back.  Oh, and now I'm getting emails, texts and phone calls.So, I've added a couple of stars (although I'm still mad that customer service is so not on top of things) and I've decided the watch isn't a total dud.

Regardless of your excursion--whether it's climbing mountains, riding a muddy bike track, or skiing off piste--you need accurate, real-time information about your surroundings to pull off a successful trip. The X-Lander contributes by not only providing important data, but also keeping track of your activities so you can make rational decisions at key moments. In addition, the watch is user-friendly and solidly built, with a non-allergenic aluminum casing, a carbon-fiber back, a durable mineral crystal glass, and a water-resistant fabric strap.The built-in altimeter, which boasts a range of up to 29,500 feet, puts all 14 of the world's 8,000-plus-meter summits within the avid climber's range. Among the altimeter's functions are an altitude measurement function that lets you follow the vertical progress between stages, an automatic 24-hour memory that stores the altitude and ascent/decent rate for every hour, and an adjustable altitude alarm. Climbers will also dig the logbook function, which lets you record total and cumulative vertical ascents and descents as well as the number of runs skied.The X-Lander also displays the current barometric pressure and temperature--a must for activities in which weather plays a factor. The device automatically records barometric data for the previous four days, with the first six hours manifested in one-hour intervals and the rest in six-hour intervals. When the reference altitude is set correctly, the instrument also displays the present sea level pressure, which makes it easier to read and understand the barometric pressure at high altitudes.And few things are more important when exploring unfamiliar territory than a compass. The X-Lander's electronic compass contributes by guiding you with cardinal or half- cardinal points and a North-South arrow. The compass can also be set to track a certain bearing, which helps you follow a chosen direction. Meanwhile, the unit's declination adjustment function allows you to correct the difference between true North and magnetic North.In addition to the variety of outdoor functions, the X-Lander also displays normal time, with such add-ons as three daily alarms, a calendar programmed to the year 2089, a stopwatch with split-time measurement, and a countdown timer. Other features include a durable negative LCD display, a user-replaceable battery, and water-resistance to 100 feet. The X-Lander is backed by a two-year warranty on parts and labor.What's in the Box?X-Lander wrist-top computer, battery, user's manual.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RpfJIscTL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B000051SEP.jpg

The robe ties in front at the throat with a long tie made from the same grey velvet material as the body of the cloak. Because of the robe's fullness, it can be worn open or tied and draped closed in front.

The maximum chest size to wear this cloak and have it fully close in front is 54.5"" (however, it will fit someone larger than that if worn open in front).

Even with a large 50 mm case this is a light weight watch. It is so light weight, I barely know it's on my wrist. All the sensors have their own large dedicated buttons. I find the barometer/thermometer feature very convenient. I never have to wonder or check the weather, I always know what temperature it is at the simple push of a button. And it can predict what the weather will be! The other feature that, I also find convenient to have is the compass. At the simple touch of a button you know which direction your going. This watch at first may make some seem a little timid. A few minutes with the instruction booklet (if you need it) and you will have all your sensors calibrated or to your liking. I prefer Fahrenheit when it comes to temperature settings and not Celsius. This watch will come with the Celsius setting from the factory. I haven't been hiking with it but the altimeter is nice to have so you can track your altitude, cumulative ascent and decent in route to your destination.  A feature that some may not consider is the clasp. The clasp is a fold over clasp and secures quite nicely. No worries of it coming lose and losing the watch. The mineral crystal is very thought, I have owned it for weeks now and not a single blemish. This is a watch that you can where to work or play. The watch is more than just watch it's like a computer on your wrist. Finally, and maybe the ultimate feature is that it's solar powered. Never have to worry about battery's again! Amazon.com has the best price on the internet. There may be an unfamiliar website that may have it for a few dollars less but it's not worth the risk. For the piece of mind and price you can't go wrong. If you have any second thoughts about this watch remember this an easy watch to use and has an easy to read instruction booklet. The booklet is a bit thick but most of the information you will not need. The box that it comes in appears to a be ""green"" box (recycled or Eco-friendly). Which, I find very appeasing that it's environmentally friendly. The Casio engineers did an awesome job on this watch. If you want to be in the know. You will want this watch. I would highly recommend this watch to all military service members.Note: I have received many questions about getting an accurate temperature reading.

Obviously those shoes do very different jobs, but I'll compare them based on size.  My street shoe size is an 11 US.  My Geshidos, which are the most similar to the Anasazi of any of my other shoes, are a size 11 US.  The Geshidos fit my foot great length wise but were slightly wide making side edges a little more tenuous.  My Testarossas are a size 42.5 EU; I definitely should have gotten these smaller as they stretched to be slightly too long and are too wide for me to get good side edging.With that info in mind, the 9.5 Anasazi fit's my foot (after two and a half weeks of climbing at least 3 times a week) great so far.  It is a somewhat aggressive fit as my toes knuckle more than in any of my other shoes.  The width, however, is great so far.  I can edge better in these shoes than in any pair I have yet owned.  The heal box is very pronounced which fits my heal perfect.  I've been able to make good heal hooks on tenuous holds in them without any slippage.  The lack of downturn makes these shoes less than ideal for really steep climbing, but that's not what I bought them for.  I bought them as all-around shoes, and so far I think they're doing perfectly.They are great for face climbing on small edges.  If aggressively sized, they are decent for roofs.  They are flat enough to comfortably drop your heel for slab climbing.  This may be my go-to all-arounder from now on.

AZ6SFXRPQB5VS,B0048W53XK,Oikono Klast,"[45, 46]","I was apprehensive about buying the SportBand after reading all the negative reviews, but in the end I went for it, figuring that the potential benefits of having a really useful and relatively inexpensive instrument outweighed the inconvenience of returning it should it prove to be a lemon or a dud. I've only had this for a day so I can't speak about its durability or longevity, but since I went through my own period of frustration in getting the watch to work, I thought I might share a few tips and save someone else a lot of hair pulling. After combing the interwebs to troubleshoot this thing, it's actually proven to be an amazing little device. What I really fault Nike for is not including and displaying this info in a conspicuous manner - say, in the instruction booklet or in the online FAQ, where people might actually see it and use it to solve the issue, rather than dreading the inevitable call to an ignoramus in customer service that will end up boosting your blood pressure and heart rate in all the wrong ways.So anyways, if your watch won't link up to the sensor here's what you can try:1. Wake up or restart the sensor. I understand many if not most of these units will be shipped with the sensor in sleep/standby mode. Push on the button once with a pen until it clicks to wake it up. To reset, hold the button for 3 seconds until it goes to sleep. Then push on the button again to wake it up.2. Reset the watch. Push and hold both the top & side buttons for 10 seconds until the screen reads ""Nike."" You'll have to plug it into your computer and use the Nike+ software to re-input your settings for weight, time, etc.3. Push and hold the SIDE button for 5 seconds. That makes the watch find the nearest sensor and link to it.I had to do all these things to resuscitate my SportBand which I thought was DOA but was in fact just a little groggy from prolonged hibernation. The other problem people - and by people I mean myself included - seem to be having is that the calibration is waaaay off. I went for a 1-mile run at a track to test its accuracy and the watch said 0.3 miles, and wouldn't even let me set the calibration in the software - WTF!? Well, turns out Nike has an expanded user manual in a PDF buried in their site somewhere, from which I culled this useful tidbit:1. THE SENSOR NEEDS TO BE ORIENTED WITH THE LOGO SIDE UP, SWOOSH POINTING TOWARDS THE HEEL. This seemed to do the trick, with the accuracy jumping from an execrable 30% to a whopping 90% - and it finally even let me fine-tune the calibration! Since I use a pouch that threads through the laces and wraps around a few times, this actually took some careful visualization.2. Apparently the sensor should be oriented as flat as possible on the shoe. I changed the location of my pouch from up by the tongue where it was nearly vertical, to down near the toe where it's more horizontal.3. This is probably just voodoo, but it may help the wireless transmission to have the sensor on the same side as the hand you're wearing the watch on. Left wrist, left shoe, and vice versa.Hope all this helps!",4.0,Don't despair - Troubleshooting tips!,1343347200,"07 27, 2012",Nike+ SportBand (Black/Cool Grey/Silver) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),19.0,Watches,"['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches']",,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vdQhI%2Bx1L._SX300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B0048W53XK.jpg

Using an old wetsuit and some sharp scissors, he made the first pair of eyewear retainers. The ingenious device was based on the design of a Chinese finger trap, and quickly became a hit with local ski patrolers. Demand picked up quickly for the patrolman's invention, which was initially nameless. Back in the seventies, the Jackson Hole ski patrol used the nickname ""croakies"" when they couldn't think of a word (think ""thing- amajig""), but it finally stuck on the world'd first neoprene eyewear retainer.Croakies headquarters are still in Jackson Hole, with production in Bozeman, Montana. The inspiration remains the same -- to create eyewear retainers and accessories that provide comfort, style, durability, and functionality to active people of all ages.

I had to perform minor surgery. I had to take pliers (which I padded with several layers of electrical tape to prevent scratching the watch) and I had to pry apart the first link (the biggest one) - where it attaches to the pin (there is an opening under the part where it attaches to the pin that you cannot see, but it is there). I then reversed the pin and squeezed the link back together. Now the watch hangs with the face away from me.I had some issues when the pin bent and the watch fell off of me a couple of times until I was able to bend the pin back to the spot so it did not fall off anymore. Unfortunately one of the times it fell off, the face cracked - but it still worked fine.I got this as a gift Christmas of 2007.

AEXXU7G5XWUXE,B000GAWSDG,Albert Trinh,"[2, 3]","This watch is a classic. It won't ever go out of style for one reason, it does what it's supposed to and it does it well. Nothing more, nothing less.Easy - It's digital so you look down and you know what time it is. Seems silly but being able to quickly read the time is nice.  Programming it is a cinch. There are only three buttons so even if the buttons weren't labeled (which they are) it's not hard to figure out. There are only basic functions like alarm, time, date, and stopwatch. That's it. You don't have to go through a million different options and weird combinations of button presses.Durable - I wore it on a camping trip to Zion and Bryce Canyon. It survived rocks, dust, water, mud, sun, and my recklessness. There's hardly a scratch on it and the watch face is still immaculate.Comfortable - It's very light and compact. I can wear it all day and not notice it. My wrists are on the smaller side so the size of the watch face suits me well. It's not overbearing like a lot of other watches for men. By the way, this is fine as a unisex watch. Much respect to all people who wear this watch, men or women. You get extra points in my book.Reliable - The battery will last. Time-telling is pretty accurate. Oddly durable. Simple. You won't mind wearing it. Also, really cheap. There's a reason these watches haven't changed. You'll have the peace of mind of knowing you can lose it and abuse it, and easily and inexpensively replace it. No need to baby it or worry about it.It seems odd to buy a watch when everyone uses cellphones for everything but once you start wearing a watch you really are more observant of time. It truly does keep you cognizant. This item belongs in the category of things like Nokia phones, Koss Porta-pros, IBM mechanical keyboards, and old Swingline staplers. They just simply work. Form and function going hand in hand. So you could spend money on a restaurant burger, a bottle of wine, a movie ticket, a drink at a bar or... you could buy this watch which will last you the next 20 years.

A242BFY5BL659U,B000QW4ENG,D. Bunnell,"[19, 20]","I used to buy the polarized fishing glasses at Wally World.  I still would, except that in a small town the selection and availability are very limited, and they won't special order for you.  So, with the help of the reviews here (thank you), I decided to try these.  At $14.40 ea (with free shipping) I ordered four pair.I wear sunglasses whenever I'm outside.  I buy a lot of cheap sunglasses rather than one pair of expensive ones (it hurts when you break them, lose them or scratch the lenses).  Doing this review made me realize what a huge inconsistency in product there is where I used to buy cheap sunglasses.  I always tried to buy the same/similar style, but now I don't think they were even mnfg'd by the same company.  They come in the same package, but it's like a jobber buys whatever is around and packages them with his label.  I've had glasses that were OK and others that variously hurt my ears, pressed into the sides of my head, dug into my nose, pushed off my face, flew off my face (not doing athletics), slipped down my face, and sat cockeyed.  I've had rubber pads pop out, glued on pads slip around and fall off, and glasses without rubber pads.  A few had the frame color painted on - the paint pealed off leaving me walking around with paint chips on my face.  And, of course, some with lenses that pop out.I've had these for about a month and have not experienced any problems so far.  The lenses are narrower (in height) than I like, but they do the job.  The tinting is good, polarization works well and they claim to block 100% UV A&B.;  A snug, comfortable fit and rubber pads on the temples and nose piece keep them secure.  The temples bow around my head (no pinching) and curve in at the ears.  The plastic is pliable enough to hold well but not be uncomfortable.  They are pretty light and at first I thought flimsy, but they are stable, tight, and don't twist and bend.  Hopefully they last a few more months, until the lenses are too scratched up to see out of.  What more could I want from cheap sunglasses (except some scratch resistance)?. . . P.S. I've started adding the price to my reviews.  I find it quite useful to see price history.Update 10/06/12 Still on my first pair!  These glasses have lasted much longer than I thought they would.

I simply plug the usb portion of the band into my laptop and it syncs: no problem.The Nike+ website is a little disappointing. I was hoping for more reporting features other than just length of run. I'd like to compare runs to other runs in graph form and put custom tags on runs based on the route I chose that day. The visualization of data is pretty week for anything other than total length/time of your run.

The Safety Cat is a self defense, personal protection tool designed mainly for women. As women we are told for safety reasons to have our keys in our hands as we go to and from our cars. Many of us even hold our keys between our fingers walking through parking lots or out doing errands so we will be able to fight off an attacker. Unfortunately, that can be cumbersome and awkward. If you're in the position of fighting off an attacker the keys may shift in your hand making it difficult for the fight to continue. The Safety Cat self defense keychain will eliminate this problem. When holding the Safety Cat, your two fingers will be placed in the eyes of the cat and the face of the cat will rest securely in the palm of your hand. The smooth, sleek design of the Safety Cat will feel very comfortable in your hand and you will be able to grasp it firmly. Remember, the Safety Cat is used for self defense purposes only, but if you're fighting for your life the unique design of the Safety Cat is made for striking at the eyes of your attacker or attacking any fleshy part of the body.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31c0pDjvZKL.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B004LUXICC.jpg

The altimeter, which measures in precise one-meter increments, has automatic and manual logging functions and can hold up to 30 records of high/low altitudes, cumulative ascent and descent, with a range from -2,300 to over 32,000 feet. That's just the beginning. The PRW 3000 has a barometer as well, which has an automatic pressure-change indicator to alert you to sudden swings, along with a pressure tendency graph and pressure differential graphic to give you a longer-term idea of what the weather's doing. To keep you on course, the compass has a graphic 16-point display for one-glance orientation, a bearing memory to keep you on route, and declination adjustment so your bearing is accurate no matter where in the world you are. We haven't even mentioned the one thing the PRW 3000's designed to do first and foremost--tell the time. It receives six atomic signals a day to ensure you're always on time, has 12- and 24-hour displays and five alarms so you never miss a mealtime, and sunset/sunrise, time zone, and calendar data. There isn't even space to discuss the stopwatch, 100m waterproofing, automatic LED, power-save function, or battery-life indicator, but trust that they're there.",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Xo5Mym-oL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B00ENCCNZQ.jpg

There are no grommets or hooks to latch on to your laces to prevent ride-up. If you don't honk down on the straps, the elastic in the bottom cuff will pull away from your trail shoe letting debris in.

AJP50EQHJ9PX8,B00BKEQBI0,simone,"[7, 15]","My husband got these via Kickstarter, where we were promised the sun, moon, and stars.  We use Apple and while we understand that the watch has better functionality with Android than it does Apple, we did not get nearly what the creators promised.  If you invested in a company that did so poorly, the SEC would investigate.The only thing this watch does for me, besides tell time, is sometimes but not always show text messages and it IDs incoming calls.  My husband has better functionality because...let's just say his apple device is different than mine.Pebble does not acknowledge tweets.  If you send an error report, they reply with a canned response that doesn't address your specific problem.  They further warn you that sending more than one message about your malfunction will only delay their response.They just released a new operating system.  Pebble sent me 7 notifications in 2 days about it.  I was in Yosemite, with limited internet and phone connectivity.  Updating the watch's OS was not my priority.  One notification will suffice!  I revoked their permission to send me notifications.When I tried to update the OS after returning to the connected world, the update failed repeatedly.  My husband also had to try repeatedly but his at least happened.You have to charge this watch...great, I needed another device to charge.  This means I leave my $150 watch home frequently because it's charging.  Also when I first had the watch, I used a white watch face, which drained the battery in a couple days, not the five or six that Pebble promised.  Charging sucks a lot of power out of your ports and it is slow.  If the watch isn't fully charged it may die before you get it back on the juice.  Sometimes for me, the charge only lasted a few hours after being connected for many.  My husband had to buy a new charging port that runs off our house electricity to charge these watches.",2.0,It Works Fine Only as a Watch,1369267200,"05 23, 2013",Pebble Smartwatch for iPhone and Android (Black),149.0,Watches,"['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Smart Watches & Accessories', 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Jewelry: International Shipping Available', 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches', 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Women', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches']",,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41t32YBS8nL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B00BKEQBI0.jpg

A1FNIV3ZVTOEFL,B00BKEQBI0,Cameron Robertson,"[5, 6]","The Pebble Smartwatch is an indispensable device for me.Starting with the hardware - beautiful, simple and eye catching, Pebble is lightweight and robust. The buttons have a solid click to them and the screen is wonderfully visible in bright sunlight, as advertised. I've also tested it while swimming and it seems to be watertight as advertised.Since I began using my Pebble there are a few things I never anticipated it would help me out with - namely two factor auth text messages from Google and discretely keeping up with text messages. The former is worth the value of the watch alone - two factor auth text messages are a massive pain given you have to pull out your phone, unlock it, etc. When they are directly on your wrist, they are practically frictionless. Additionally, mundane text messages that may have previously interrupted dinner or a good conversation can be quickly reviewed by peeking at my wrist.One of my biggest concerns about a smartwatch was the battery life - I'm consistently getting a week with Pebble. And quite frankly if I had to charge my watch on a daily basis, I wouldn't be interested. I'm hopeful that future updates make this even longer.It's also been great to see the progress in software updates that the Pebble folks have been putting out - they clearly want Pebble to get better over time and it shows.

Even when my eyes are very blurry I can still see this watch fairly clearly!!!!!!A plus for me is that this watch will really do it all from timing my cycling laps to just being an ordinary watch for my everyday life. If I need a dress watch I'll dig out one of my older watches that I can't see as well but they will just be bling on my wrist for the occasion!ADDED 2/12/13.....................The INDIGLO light just failed which from what I read online is a common fault with this watch. This is a darn shame to since this is a fine time piece otherwise.ADDED 2/13/13.......Today the alarm started going off even tho I never set it!!  Alarm will also not shut off no matter which button I push!!!!!ADDED 2/15/13.....Sent watch back for warranty replacement. Hope I get a better one next time since this is a nice watch really.,1.0,Mine turned out to be troublesome......,1357603200,"01 8, 2013",Timex Men's T49896 Expedition Rugged Shock Digital Chrono Alarm Timer All Black Resin Strap Watch,34.22,Watches,"['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Watches', 'Wrist Watches']","The Timex Men's T498969J Expedition Full Size Chrono Alarm Timer Watch is a great example of a cool, casual timepiece packed with style.

Composed of 100 percent New Zealand merino wool, the Icebreaker Bodyfit260 line takes high-tech, high-performance sport clothing back to nature with its natural fiber construction. A base layer in cold conditions, and a standalone during high aerobic activities and in warmer temperatures, the Bodyfit 260 Mid-weight Tech Top is highly breathable, will not hold odors, and offers maximum warmth with great temperature regulation for high-performance comfort.Icebreaker uses the best superfine merino in the world, from the mountains of New Zealand. In contrast to synthetics, the Icebreaker merino fabric is finer, softer, more insulating, and more breathable than alternative fabric types. The lightweight, odor-resistant, and soft-against-the-skin fabric breathes better than other garments because each individual merino fiber breathes as well as the fabric, allowing your body to release moisture vapor so that you never feel clammy.The Bodyfit260 Mid-weight Tech Top has a three-way collar that will zip up to a high neck, zip down for cooling, or roll over. A slim fit offers a form-flattering look and flat seams provide zero-abrasion comfort. The all-natural merino fabric features a circular knit that offers a natural stretch that will maintain its shape over years of use. With a dropped tail and thumb loops the shirt will stay in place even through the most rigorous activities. Easy to care for, the Mid-weight Tech Top is machine washable and fast drying. Additionally, the Bodyfit260 fabric will not absorb odors as synthetic fabrics do.Specifications:Base layer100 percent New Zealand merino wool260g/m2 ColdCircular knit with natural stretchRaglan long sleevesHigh neckThree-way collar (zip up, down, or up and rolled)Thumb loopsDropped tailFlat seamsBreathableOdor freeSize Specifications:X-Small: Bust 33 inches; height 62.5 inchesSmall: Bust 35 inches; height 64 inchesMedium: Bust 37 inches; height 66 inchesLarge: Bust 39 inches; height 67.5 inchesX-Large: Bust 40.5 inches; height 69 inchesCare Specifications:Icebreaker garments almost look after themselves because they don't hold moisture or odor. In fact, the known record for wearing an Icebreaker non-stop is 196 days in extreme conditions. Here are a few tips to get the best out of your Icebreaker.Use warm or cool machine-wash on normal cycleWash separately first (after 2 to 3 days use) to remove any loose fibersWash with like colorsWash on a normal cycle with other hard fabrics to remove fluffingNever use a fabric softenerDo not use detergents with bleachDo not tumble dry--dry flat in the shade or on the clotheslineAbout Icebreaker Merino WoolIcebreaker uses the best superfine merino in the world, from the mountains of New Zealand in all of its garments. Icebreaker's merino fiber was created by nature to protect animals in the harsh environment of New Zealand's Southern Alps. If the fiber didn't work, the animals wouldn't survive. Recognizing that it couldn't design a better fiber, Icebreaker turned nature's merino wool into a clothing system for humans. In contrast to synthetics, Icebreaker merino is 100 percent natural. The fabric created is finer, softer, more insulating, and more breathable than alternative fabric types.Icebreaker merino forms a buffer zone around your body, keeping you at an ideal temperature in all climates and conditions. It's also lightweight, odor-resistant and soft against the skin--all qualities that will help you to perform at your peak. Because Icebreaker merino fibers are so fine, they are naturally more breathable, so you stay cool in the hottest conditions. It feels very different than synthetics, where breathability is limited.Icebreaker garments breath better than other garments because each individual merino fiber breathes as well as the fabric allowing your body to release moisture vapor so that you never feel clammy. In a warm, high aerobic environment, sweat is pulled from the body into the fabric, and dispersed and metabolized as moisture vapor through the outside of the garment, cooling the body through evaporation. In cold temperatures, when moisture is absorbed from the cold air, Icebreaker merino fibers liberate heat through a molecular process call ""heat of sorption"" to keep you warm.Manufacturer Warranty1-year warranty",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GxXM9LRFL._SY300_.jpg,data/amazon product/images/B001F50H48.jpg
